<p class="pfirst"><span>It was in "</span><em class="italics">Aldersyde</em><span>" many years ago that
I first met Mrs. Burnett Smith, writing then
as during the intervening years under the pen
name of Annie S. Swan, beloved of all readers
of wholesome books.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Many times since I have met her—acquaintance
ripened into friendship—visit succeeded
visit, until now upon the occasion of her official
visit to the United States it has been the good
fortune of myself and my family to entertain
her as an honoured guest.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the course of our quiet talks Mrs. Burnett
Smith has told me the story of her life in
England, just outside of London, since war
began.  Her experiences were so varied, yet so
typical of what the Englishwoman has been
called upon to endure, that I begged of her to
make record of them for her friends in
America.  She demurred until I reminded her that
she was in our debt many letters—hence the
intimate form of this narrative.  Indeed it was
only by urging the personal obligation that she
has been persuaded to tell her story, which it is
my proud privilege to publish in this form.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>My Dear: To-day I opened the cedar
wood box—I can see the little wrinkle of your
level brows over these cryptic words, can
almost hear you ask why something so simple
should be chronicled as a war time event.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I expect you remember just where the box
stood on the little very old table at the left side
of my study window.  It was often between us,
when we had those wonderful talks in the
summer of 1913.  Once I remember I removed
it gently out of your reach, as you thumped its
precious lid rather hard to emphasise your
indignation over the accumulated injustices of
life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is far removed now from the delicate setting
you so much approved, the red rose of the
window hangings no longer accentuates its
quaint outline.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It now stands bald and bare on the
workman-like writing table in the smoking room of
our Kingdom by the Sea.  You never achieved
acquaintance with this dear place in your
extensive yet inadequate travel year, owing to
George's feverish desire to transport you to
the particular bit of Germany he had so long
idealised.  I am thinking now of his chastened
demeanour when he brought you back.
Something had gone out of his early dream; that
elusive essence which once gone can never be
recaptured.  Youth is ours only once—we
may go on pretending; but there comes no
second spring.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Your letters—and certain of George's—considered
by his critic worthy of the privilege,
have always been "taken care of" (I love that
comforting American phrase) in the cedar
wood box.  It so happens that it is the one
intimate thing I have brought here with me.  It
was picked up in the garden with part of its
contents scattered, after making a hasty exit
through the window—Heavens!  I hear you
say—what can she be talking about—and why
is she so far from her base in war time?  Here
is the bald and awful fact—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There is no more North House.  Have
you taken it in, Cornelia?  You loved its
simple dignity, its old-world repose.  You
had no fault to find because it did not
spread itself to any great extent, and lacked all
the wonderful conveniences to which you are
accustomed in your own home.  You allowed
it the defects of its quality, nay, I even believe
that you loved them.  Did you not put your
hand over my mouth when I audibly wished
that my mauve thistle spare bedroom had been
a more spacious chamber, where you could sit
or stand at an angle immune from draughts, or
from bumping against some aggressive article
of furniture.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I often apologised for the one bathroom,
small at that, and for the inadequate supply of
hot water.  Then you would point to the moss-grown
terrace at the back, the cedar tree on the
lawn, sloping to the winding river, and the
delicate vistas beyond.  "Oh yes," I said, "it is
the only garden in the world, but the house
could be improved on."  Did I really say that?
I know I did, not once, but a thousand times,
and now I am the prey of a most unendurable
kind of remorse, that which we feel when
something we loved is removed permanently
from our sight and we know we belittled it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now perhaps you will understand, Cornelia,—the
home we all loved together—though
often belittling it in the grumpy Scotch
way—is dead.  It will never be ours any more.
Its roof can never shelter those we love, nor
its walls echo the happy laughter which doeth
good like a medicine.  I see the bewilderment
gathering in your quizzical eyes, and you
wonder what it is all about, and whether I have
taken leave of the small modicum of sense
Himself and you allotted to me the last time
we discussed the question together.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The truth is, I am afraid to begin.  I do not
know how to tell it.  The world is full of
words—but there do not seem to be any to fit
this case.  But I must try.  I have been
sitting ever so long, looking out to the sea, which
is no longer a pathway to the sun, but a
menacing grey highway across which awful shapes
may at any moment race to destroy our peace,
and fill us with terror and dismay.  To the
left, as I turn my eyes, through the window
I see the gleaming nozzle of one of the big
guns, with the gunners ready beside it.  They
are there night and day.  So even our
summer home is in the grip of the war monster
from which there is no escape.  It is the 16th
of October and the skies are very grey, the air
heavy with a strange chill, the sea mists are
creeping up—and the moan of the breakers
against the rocks seems to presage some coming doom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was very lovely in Hertfordshire in
October—its early weeks gave us a taste of the
most beautiful Indian summer I have ever
seen.  Our chestnut trees were never more
glorious, nor more vividly clad.  Flame was
the keynote of the colour scheme, and it
lingered—wonderfully blent with all the
undertones of departing summer, till the picture our
garden presented was so entrancing, I could
not attend to my ordinary tasks, grudging
every moment spent away from it.  We were
clearing the herbaceous borders—and planning
a new scheme for enhancing the beauty of
the lily pond.  I had long serious discussions
with the gardener, an understanding creature,
about economy in bulbs.  The true garden-lover
would do without clothes, rather than
raiment for her garden; but we had to
patriotically compromise, and, with a little
ingenuity and extra planning, saw a very promising
vista for the spring.  You have noticed,
indeed, it was, I think, more than once the
subject of our talk, that the last summer of a
person's life is often the most beautiful.  It
was so with our boy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Do you remember how I told you that when
our little fishing expedition at Amulree came
to an end in 1910, and the children were so loth
to leave the old inn and the everlasting hills,
I said to him, "Never mind, son, next summer
when Dad and I go to America to visit Uncle
George and Aunt Cornelia, you and Effie will
come here all by yourselves, or with Aunt Jack,
and have it all over again."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He turned his big quiet grey eyes on mine
and said very simply, "These things don't
happen, Mummy."  He was very young when he
learned that lesson.  It all came true, not in
my sense, but in his.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Before the next summer came, his dear
beautiful body was laid on the cliff side at the
Kingdom by the Sea and his soul had stolen
"away" to his appointed place in his Father's
House.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>That was the most beautiful summer in our
lives—not in his only, but in our whole family
life, of a richness and nearness and dearness,
to describe which, there are no words.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Well, and this the last summer of our garden's
life, in so far as it concerned us, was the
most beautiful we have ever known, in a
circle of many summers, all beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Never had there been such wealth of bloom.
The roses!  They simply flung themselves in
regal magnificence at our feet.  The more you
cut and gave away the more persistently they
insisted upon coming on; not in single spies,
but in battalions.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old walled vegetable garden which you
so loved, being invariably found, when missing,
between its box hedges, surpassed itself.
We could not use the stuff.  Our Belgian
household over the way, of whose doing and
being I as chairman of the Belgian Guest
committee have written you so much, had access
to the garden to help themselves.  It is a royal
memory we have; but only a memory.  Sometimes
it seems as if soon, all life would be only
a memory.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Hope seems—for the moment—to have
folded her tent like the Arabs, and silently
stolen away.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>On the 12th Effie came home from France
in her first leave from active service.  You can
imagine the excitement in the household, the
somewhat tremulous expectancy of Himself
and myself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The one ewe lamb, as you know right well,
is a kind of desperate possession.  Once or
twice I have recalled your warning counsel not
to let her leave us; but, my dear, you would
have to be here to understand the strange new
blood that is firing the veins of both youth and
maturity and age, the red blood of patriotism.
She was very young to go out to that strange
awful sublime place they call the war zone.
But she came back to us radiant, quite
unchanged; but yes, there is a change.  She has
the eyes of one who, born in a great time, is
striving to live greatly.  She was, before the
war, one of the lotus flowers to whom the call
came opportunely, and now she is blooming
for others all unconscious of herself.  You
who have known and shared my anxieties about
her future, will rejoice with me, I know.  She
is not a good letter writer, she has the very
Scotch habit of leaving out all you want to
know.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A dear English friend of mine, whose name
I must not tell you, speaking of her husband,
one day in a moment of exasperation said,
"You have to take too much for granted with
a Scotch husband."  I smiled comprehendingly,
having lived so long with Himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Effie is a little like that.  You never know
what is shut up inside of her.  The Boy was
so different, so easy to know—and so lovely
when you did know him.  Well I suppose it
would not be good for us to be given without
effort or seeking the key to every treasure
house.  Heavens, how I wander!  I must
come back and tell about the thing to which
Effie came home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We had had a quiet lovely day together.
I had managed to worm a little out of her about
her beloved camp at Etaples, not half enough—but
just enough to know what this wonderful
new life of service for others is doing for the
child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Himself was rather busy, and had to go out
after dinner to see some patients who required
a late visit.  The house surgeon from the
hospital had just dropped in asking for him and
we kept him, expecting that Himself would be
back quickly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At half past nine, tea came up.  Do you
remember how you, and especially George,
jeered at our evening teacups, and how
gradually you were drawn into the snare until you
acquired the passion, and used to watch the
library clock, sure the kitchen one did not correspond?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I had a restless feeling that night.  It was
very dark, with a close sultry air, and I went
upstairs throwing open windows that had been
shut.  I was standing at the open window of
Himself's dressing room when I heard the
unmistakable whirr of the Zeppelin engine.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have tried to describe it to you before.  It
is a sinister grinding noise, unlike anything on
earth.  I flew down to tell them that the
Zeppelins were out.  Effie, eager with the quick
longing of youth for every adventure, said,
"No such luck," and we immediately went out
on the terrace to crane our necks in an
endeavour to discover the marauder's silver
silhouette against the clear dark sky.  Then
quite suddenly there was the most terrific bang,
and somewhere in the near distance strange
lights like shooting stars seemed to descend
upon our little inoffensive town—we stood
dumb, holding our breath, while the bangs
continued getting louder and louder.  Presently,
we were joined by the terrified servants, who,
at their supper in the basement kitchen,
unaware that the Zeppelins were in the
neighbourhood, came rushing out.  The young ones
were inclined to scream.  I remember laying
my hand on somebody's arm, and saying,
"Hush, be still!"  To me it was a stupendous
moment, during which the whole fabric of
existence seemed to be tottering—and we on the
edge of some unimaginable abyss.  I remember
Effie's face lit by the weird glare from the
incendiary bombs now falling in rapid succession
from the upper air.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was no fear upon it, only a kind of
uplifted spirituelle look.  I seem to remember
that she said, "Do you think it will be this one,
Mummy?" but she stoutly denies having uttered
any such words.  Presently, however,
"this one" descended and found its mark.  The
din was indescribable; conceive of forty-two
bombs dropping in a limited area in the space
of four minutes, the glare of their bursting,
the air full of sulphurous fumes and an awful
indescribable sense of evil, imminent, devilish,
against which we were absolutely helpless and
unarmed.  As we stood there in absolute
silence, holding on one to another, we had no
sort of knowledge or information that our very
own house was being destroyed.  To you this
may seem incredible, when you reflect that the
terrace, though wide, is joined to the house.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was all so quick and so terrible, that we
felt it must be the end of the world, the total
destruction of everything we had considered
stable in our earthly life.  Presently, the
voice of the man beside us spoke: "I think it's
over now, and we're safe."  The air-ship,
sailing low, so that we saw it distinctly between
the cone of the cedar tree and the sky,
disappeared rapidly and the noise of explosions
ceased—only to be replaced by the cries of
excited people, and the moans of the hurt and
dying in the street.  The darkness was profound,
the power station having been destroyed early
in the attack.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We pulled ourselves together, and proceeded
towards the house with a view of entering.
Part of the walls remained standing,
but there was no house.  There in the middle
of the beautiful hall you so much admired the
whole fabric seemed to have collapsed.  Doors,
windows, furniture, pictures, piled in an
inextricable heap.  We saw right out into the
street in the further side, where already there
were twinkling lights and moving figures as
the work of mercy and assistance began.  But
where was Himself?</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Quickly people began to climb in upon our
ruins, seeking presumably for us or for our
remains.  Presently, among them, very white in
the face, and very glassy about the eyes,
appeared Himself, wheeling his bicycle.  They
had told him down the street that his home and
every one in it had been destroyed.  He
counted us,—we clung together for just a
moment, then he said, "I must go."  "Where?"
I asked, still holding on.  "To my job," he
answered as he unstrapped his emergency bag
from his machine and strode away.  We did
not see him any more till the early morning,
he and his colleagues being busy at the
hospital.  Then the whole population seemed to
be crowding us where we stood.  We had no
lights but a few stray candles.  Police and
military presently appeared to take possession,
and the general public were excluded.  The
accredited powers climbed across the debris to
reach the garden, when a strange sight
presented itself.  Five incendiary bombs which
had been dropped after the explosive ones and
were intended to complete the work of
destruction, had only sunk in the soft earth, and
were burning there like bale fires.  The
authorities were hunting for unexploded bombs,
always a terrific menace until handled by
experts and shorn of their hellish power.  They
said, and say still, that one is at the bottom of
the river where it can't do any harm.  We tried
to go up what remained of the staircase.  The
secondary staircase which connected the old
wing with the more modern part, was blown
into space; not a step of it remained.  The
beds, which had been in the rooms of the old
wing, were outside somewhere, their twisted
metal work and torn mattresses being
afterwards found near the railings of the front
garden.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You remember the mysterious little passage
with the double doors that led from my
bedroom into the old wing; well, it was entirely
gone; cut off as clean as if a knife had done it.
We were very adventurous, climbing about
trying to see by candlelight the full extent of
the damage, and with nobody to tell us that
we took our lives in our hands every minute
where walls were tottering, and ceilings, so
to speak, hanging by a thread.  My eight-foot
old mahogany wardrobe which you admired
so much had climbed upon my bed, and half
the ceiling was on the top of that.  Conceive
what would have happened had the attack
come without warning, when we were asleep
in our beds!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It has happened in other places.  The
protecting mercy of God was over and round
about us—our time had not yet come.  I had
then no feeling of anguish over my ruined
home, none of us had.  To Effie, it was a great
adventure—the War in concrete visible
tangible form!  We simply did not realise what it
all meant; I suppose we shall realise it right
enough later on.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Midnight came—one o'clock in the morning—two
o'clock—Himself turned up at last and
insisted that I should find a billet somewhere
and lie down.  He and Effie determined to
keep a vigil in the ruins.  A fine rain had
begun to fall, but there were dry places in the
house, a corner of the drawing room queerly
almost untouched.  The vagaries of the
concussion were beyond belief.  The gable end of
the dining room left standing was stripped
inside of every scrap of plaster, leaving the
lathes naked and bare.  An old Chippendale
mirror still stuck heroically to its nail, above
the mantel, or rather the place where the
mantel had been, not shattered or scratched.  But
all the lovely old ladder-back chairs are gone
and the sideboard.  I shan't really know till
I go back whether we have anything left.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Effie took me up to my billet in a neighbour's
house, and as we groped our way by the
railings in the inky darkness I suddenly clutched
something soft.  The flashlight revealed part
of our dining room curtains—heavy silk
damask ones, that had evidently been blown clean
out up the street, and twisted round the
railings by invisible hands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I did not sleep any, you may be sure.  I
was the slave of physical fear after the
excitement had died down.  Shaking in every
limb, even to my lips, I lay till about six
o'clock, then got up again and dressed to go
and seek my treasures.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The sun was shining cheerfully as I wended
my way through the gaping crowds which had
come from God knows where, getting a
sympathetic word and grip here and there from
familiar friends.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And presently I came to the North House
gate, Oh Cornelia!</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>It all looked so piteous in the clear sunlight,
the shell of the dear home; the inextricable
mass of plaster and bricks and broken wood
work and all the belongings of a house.  The
crowds, there seemed to be millions of them,
everywhere fell back to let me go in.  Himself
met me, smiling bravely, but a little grim about
the eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We are going to breakfast at the Odell's,"
he said, "and after that you and Effie go off to
Scotland; it is all arranged."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was no use protesting—you know how
Himself can look, and what it means when he
says a thing has got to be done.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We hung about a little, and I had a sort
of resentment because the public were all over
the place where my house had been.  They were
not our own townsfolk, but incomers, who
had arrived in motors, in horse traps, on
bicycles from miles away.  The North road was
simply black with them.  We went off
presently in a cab to our kind neighbour's house,
where we had a good breakfast and much
sympathy, which seemed to put fresh heart into
us.  When we got back, it was to get ready
for our journey to Scotland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Somebody found my clothes; people I had
never seen before seemed to be packing them
up in trunks, not ours, which appeared
mysteriously from the outside.  Kind hands
brought us lunch, already prepared, and so
we got ready to go away.  But before the end
I had a hard task.  Poor Tubby, the lovely old
mother chow, had gone mad, or at least become
dangerous through sheer terror.  You know
how sensitive she was.  She had to be shot and
nobody could get her out of the kennel but
me.  I went and dragged her forth and put
the collar around her neck and took her to
the place of execution, where the man with the
gun was waiting.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How did I do it?  God knows, Cornelia.
But it was absolutely necessary for the safety
of human creatures, and I know she has
forgiven me in the happy hunting ground where
she has gone.  She knew I loved her; but when
I heard the report of the gun the iron seemed
to enter into my soul.  Wang has gone too,
and Satan, the impish and delicious Persian
cat that became an inmate of this animal-loving
house after you left, was found stark by
the edge of the immense crater made in the
front garden by the bursting shell.  It wiped
out his favorite laurel bush, under which we
suppose he had been sleeping when the terror came.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was not injured in any way—he died of
the same concussion which split the old cedar
tree and broke it right in two.  Soon after
eleven we trundled away to the station en
route for London and Scotland, leaving
Himself to make shift alone.  It was his
ordination, and we seemed too dazed to stand up
against it.  We have been here three days, and
already Effie and I are both very restless.  I
expect in a few more days in spite of Himself
we shall be speeding back, for there is much
to do there.  First and foremost we have to
find another roof to cover us.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I will write as soon as I get back, and can
co-ordinate my thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You and George will mourn with us, and
I have no doubt George's sentiments on the
subject of America entering without further
parley will be vivified and strengthened.  As
I write I see the desolate ruins—the broken
and desecrated household gods, the crowds
of gaping strangers who regarded it as a
spectacle without appearing to sense its tragedy.
Other houses in the town were destroyed, but
I have presently no knowledge or cognisance
of them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>All sorrow and loss must be intensive at
the first.  This certainly is.  It is a poor
devilish kind of sport, to rain death upon
non-combatants and sail away immune from
punishment or reprisal.  It makes women dumb
and men desperate.  I know what is in the
mind of Himself.  Loathing of the age limit,
longing to defy the years and be out with the
fighting forces in the field.  I shall never keep
him after this, Cornelia.  He will slip through
another door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Is there a light?  Yes, I remember kind faces
I never saw before looking eloquently into
mine, the clasp of strange but friendly hands,
the offer of a score of homes.  The gleam of
brotherhood and sisterhood lightens the dark
places of the earth, and defies organised and
perfected cruelty to do its worst.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 4em">
</div>
<p class="center pfirst" id="iii"><span class="bold large">III</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>It is three weeks since I wrote my last
letter—two weeks and three days since I came
back—no, not home, only back.  We have no home
any more—as we used to have it, though we
have found a roof to cover us.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I got your cablegram yesterday—it was
dear of you to send it, but my spirit quailed
at what it must have cost you to send such
a lengthy despatch.  Of course we knew
how George and you would feel about it,
and there was a curious softness in
Himself's eyes when I showed it to him; we
even discussed whether we should launch out
into a similar extravagance.  We decided,
however, that no adequate presentment of what
we were doing could be offered in any
cablegram, and that we must ask you to wait for
another letter.  Himself even said, he would
write it, but you know how he lives, and what
stacks of unanswered ones lie in his pigeon-holes.
I heard him say in an exasperated moment,
that his private and particular hell would
be a place where there were unending streams
of letters of no importance, which he would
be compelled to answer by return of post.  It
was he who suggested the one word, "reconstructing,"
and we both hope you grasped its
full significance.  It is a big word, and it means
a lot.  Before there can be reconstruction, there
has to be destruction, and the </span><em class="italics">Hun</em><span> has done
it very thoroughly for us.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I had better go back, I think, to where I
left off.  I told you, I remember, that after
three days both Effie and I grew restless, and
on the sixth we wired Himself that we were
coming back and that he must find a place
for us.  We knew that he was still sleeping on
a shake-down in the corner of the drawing
room where the free winds of Heaven blew
in upon him—and the rain when it chanced
that way.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You know how he loved everything in the
house, how much of it was his individual choice,
only the grouping left to me.  And he was
hanging on desperately to the remnant of
his treasure house—though forbidden by
official orders to touch anything until the
representative from the Government Air Raid
Insurance should come to inspect the premises,
and the damage.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When we arrived we found it arranged for
us to stay at the Wrights' house.  You
remember how you liked them, free, jolly,
unconventional people, who understand hospitality
in the big sense, which makes you feel at home
in their house.  I can never forget what they
have done for us at this time; and they were
only two out of many.  Effie remained only
long enough to collect her kit and go back to
her beloved Camiers—of course the house
couldn't mean as much to her; and for the time
being she is detached from us and her usual
surroundings.  She went off gaily and gladly,
not aware I am sure of the heartache she left
behind.  She will be the heroine of a great
adventure when she gets back to her comrades.
But I am sure she will never tell how fearlessly
she carried herself through it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To us—that is to me, principally, is left the
work of reconstruction.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We have got the loan of a house from a
kind neighbour who volunteered to find his
family other quarters.  They all felt that
Himself must have quarters as near as possible to
the old place, so that his patients could easily
find him, and his professional work be carried
on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You will remember the house, a wide red
brick many-windowed structure, standing
sheer on the street just opposite St. Andrew's
Church.  You will particularly remember it
because you asked me what style of architecture
its porch was supposed to represent.  I
replied that I had been told it was Chinese
Chippendale.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You said, "Whatever is that, anyway?"  And
we both laughed.  Behold us then, installed
in the house of the Chinese Chippendale
porch.  It's just round the corner from
the North House, less than two minutes' walk.
It is very strange and rather awful, I find,
to live with other people's things.  They don't
belong to you.  There is no intimate touch,
and you don't in the least want to arrange
them or show them to the best advantage.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There are more chairs in this house than
in any house I have ever seen or heard tell
of—the sort you don't want to sit on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is too full of everything for comfort, but
the beds are beautiful, and it is such a relief to
have a shelter, that we never can be grateful
enough.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Cornelia, I wonder if you will understand
that I was two whole days here, nearly three,
indeed, before I dared to go round the corner.
I simply couldn't; but at last, quite early one
morning before many people were about, and
Himself was safely out of the way, I stole
round.  There was a policeman at the gate,
for there were heaps of things that could easily
be removed by predatory hands.  Wooden
barricades had been erected everywhere, and
what windows were left were boarded over.
The man touched his hat to me, but did not
open his mouth.  He was an understanding
creature, who saw how it was with me.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Before I went inside I took a bird's-eye view
of what had happened outside.  There was
a great gap in the wall of the kitchen garden
which flanked the street, a gap big enough to
let a horse and cart through.  In this street
just by the kerb you could see where the crater
made by a shell explosion had been filled up.
I forget whether I mentioned in my first
letter how that particular shell had broken the
water main, causing a small deluge to add to
the general horror of that night of desolation.
I went into the garden through the gap, and
round about, to the river's brim, thankful to
find little damage, except much trampling of
the lawns.  The gardeners, I think, had gone
to their breakfast—at least, I did not see either
of them.  All the time I kept my eyes averted
from the house; but when I came behind the
cedar tree, half of which was torn away, showing
a hideous scar all over its beautiful body,
I could not help seeing.  I gripped myself
tight, and ran, just ran up the sloping lawn
across the terrace, and right in.  I don't know
how I can describe it.  I feel as if I must not
even try.  Nothing had been touched.  It was
sealed, so to speak, by Government orders.  A
few things had been covered up to prevent the
rain damaging them.  It was just awful,
indescribable, heartrending.  The dining room
was pitch dark, but a candle standing on
the seat of a broken chair with matches
beside it invited me to inspection.  I can't
describe what I saw, and there seemed to be
a faint odour of sulphur and brimstone
redolent of the bottomless pit.  The drawing room
had suffered least, though part of the ceiling
had fallen on the piano, marring its beautiful
top.  The shake-down on which Himself had
slept all the time we were away, stood in what
looked like the safest corner.  He had set up
a screen to keep the night winds off his dear
head.  I just sat down there and after a
minute tears came.  They were the first I had
shed and they were blessed.  They relieved
the tightness of my heart, the band across my
brain.  Afterwards I was able to climb in and
about, taking stock and inventory of what
had happened.  I thought that with luck a
few sticks might be retrieved, and mended up,
but knew that all my cupboards must be bare
of the glass and china which every housewife
holds most dear.  You remember the cupboard
in the dining room with its priceless store of
Waterford and old English glass?  There is
not so much as a salt cellar left.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A cup here and there, with the handle off,
or a gash in its side is all that is left of my
Crown Derby, my old Worcester, my Lowestoft.
It is all very awful.  But these are only
things.  They don't at this moment matter.
What does matter is that the monster of war
has laid its foul desecrating hand on the
sanctuary of my home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In a flash of lightning, the suffering of
France, of Belgium and all the invaded countries
stood revealed.  I understand, and I know
why our sweet dignified old Belgian refugee
guest, Madame Savarin, spat upon the
remnants of the bomb I showed her yesterday.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Himself got George's second cable this
morning.  When I read it the words of the old
hymn flashed back, "Death like a narrow sea
divides that happy land from ours."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I wonder if you just quite know how safe
and free and happy you are on the other side of
the Atlantic.  I see you knit your brows, and
hear George's language, occasionally,—I regret
to say, not quite fit to grace any very genteel
chronicle.  I hope this is going to be a
little more than that anyway.  I will take
back the last adjective, and beg you to thank
God that you are safe and free for a little
while longer.  Happy I know you and your
kind will never be until you are standing
shoulder to shoulder with us in this awful but
glorious fight.  I don't know how George's cable
ever got through, really, on your side or ours.
Conceive what would have happened had he
presented it at any telegraph office in
Germany.  His head would have paid the forfeit.
I am going to set it down here just to see how
it looks in real writing with the cold official
script.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There, what do you think of it?  I only hope
you are properly proud of George.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>All the Georges are nice.  There is
something comforting about them.  Shall I ever
forget the other George, whom you too liked,
who flew to us when the Heavens darkened in
1910.  He was here again at this time, the
moment he could be of any use.  When we are
in trouble, his own affairs, however urgent,
have to stand by.  It is wonderful to have
friends like that.  They are a shield and
buckler in the day of trouble.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Well, I laughed out loud when I read
George's cablegram and it did me so much
good that I wish he would think up a new one
every day, each one more violent than the
other.  It would never exceed or even fit the
crime.  Perhaps you wonder how I can joke
and play about with words in the midst of
what is happening.  I have to, Cornelia.  Don't
you understand?  If I didn't I should never
be able to carry on?  And when I sit down in
obedience to George's express command by
cable to tell you every single solitary
thing—though how he ever expects it to be allowed
out of the country I don't know, my spirit
positively quails.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is very awful, my dear—much more awful
than it seemed at first.  I am now spending
all my days in the ruins, mostly quite alone,
trying to retrieve what remains of our
household gods.  I am allowed to do this since
the day the Government Insurance Inspector
came, and, having inspected, pronounced and
assessed the damage, unsealed the debris, and
went away—I don't doubt, quite satisfied with
himself.  I suppose there is some kind of a
system for the appointment of such officials,
perhaps the less they know about their job the
better.  This one had no sort of conception
of values.  I tried to explain some of them,
but soon gave out, and let him carry on.  Let
me try to give you some idea of the tragic
comedy.  He was elderly, quiet and polite, not
in the least sympathetic, because I am only one
of many similarly placed, and sentiment
interferes with business.  His job was to minimise
our loss.  What was mine, I wonder?  I'm not
sure, but this I do know, that it hurt, hurt
desperately, to have to stand by, and hear this
well-meaning person make light of what had
happened.  Once or twice I longed to see
Wang come bounding out of the unknown
with his lovely face distorted, his bristles
standing up and his growls like distant thunder
in the air, but alas, I have to go through this
thing quite alone.  Himself couldn't do it—even
if he weren't too busy.  He would just
have a stand-up fight with the government
representative, and that would be an end of
compensation, though no doubt Himself would
enjoy the tussle immensely.  We didn't know
quite where to begin.  A table was erected in
what is left of the library, and he spread out
his inventory sheets and we started in.  I had
made an inventory too, and the contents of the
dining room came under discussion first.  He
had a copy of this which had been previously
submitted to him through our lawyer.  His
business was now to assess the amount they
would pay.  He put down the entire contents
of the glass cupboard at ten pounds.  Fifty
dollars of your money.  I gently but firmly
pointed out that there were single pieces in it
that had cost that.  He shook his head, and
explained that in that case each piece should
have been insured separately, as in the case
of articles of jewellery.  That was the
platform from which he never departed, and I
quickly realised that our cause was lost.  Six
dollars he allowed for that priceless old
Chamberlain Worcester tea service over which you
raved so often, warning me that it should not
be used every day.  But you know we have
never kept anything just for ornament; or
lived in a house as a mere show place.  The
other George, of whom I've just been speaking,
once told me I could make a home out of
a cave, supposing I had only a handful of twigs
to start with.  Well, that is how we have lived.
The Insurance gentleman was more reasonable
about large solid articles of furniture, with
which he seemed to be quite familiar.  I don't
suppose he observed at what an early stage
I gave up the ghost and simply allowed him
to carry on, and put down what figures he
liked.  He visibly brightened, however, as the
ghastly inspection proceeded, and became more
and more friendly every minute, but not any
more understanding.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I got even with him over Effie's clothes.
You know she wears only uniform in France,
with one simple silk or crêpe-de-chine frock
for the rare occasions when she goes out to
dine, or to some informal hospital dance.  So
all her clothes were down in the wardrobe room,
and they had been pulled out of the debris,
and laid, a melancholy array, on the only bed
left standing, which happened to be her own.
You can imagine what last year's frocks look
like, especially when they have been a good
deal worn, and finally come through an air
raid.  A torn and crumpled mass of satin and
lace and chiffon, stained with lime and water.
The sight seemed to affect the official mind
profoundly; though my shattered treasures had
left him cold.  He asked their values, touching
them rather pitifully; perhaps he visualised
the radiant youth they had once enfolded, and
I may have been misjudging him all along.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He then asked bluntly what they had cost.
I replied vaguely about ten pounds each.  He
put down fifty pounds without a murmur, and
hurried out of the room as if he had had
enough.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It took the whole long, long day, Cornelia,
and when he went out for his lunch I sat among
the ruins, and ate the dry sandwich Florence
had put up for me.  I fear I watered it with
my tears.  I never knew there could be so
many tears in the world.  I had none to shed
when the Boy went away; but somehow this
has unsealed the fount.  It is a different kind
of grief; it tears you a thousand ways;
sometimes you are shaken with an impotent rage.
Of course it means that it will be more evanescent.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The heart can only stand a certain number
of vital, staggering blows.  After the assessing
business was over I was free, so to speak, of
what remained of my own possessions, and I
have been going round every day immediately
after breakfast and stopping until dusk drove
me away.  Lots of people wanted to help.  I
didn't want them—I had to be alone with my
ghosts.  Florence would come round now and
again when her work was done, or between
whiles, and then we just stood together
thinking unutterable things.  She is not quite a
servant, as you know, but a dear faithful,
understanding friend who lives in the heart of us,
and loves us every one.  But mostly I was
alone, my job to gather up the fragments—the
little things, and try to gauge and co-ordinate
the whole before the removal men came to take
everything away.  I found quite a lot of things
and carried them one by one to one of the
pantries where a shelf remained intact.  My
greatest find, in a place with which they had no
connection whatever, was four cut crystal
baskets belonging to the old Sheffield plate
epergne, we used as a centrepiece in the days
when table decoration was of the heavy ornate
type.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How pleased I was to get them, you can't
think!  I held them tight quite a long time,
gave them a little polish with the corner of
my apron, and then took them to the pantry
shelf aforesaid, where I regarded them with
a species of adoration as the nucleus of some
future glass cupboard collection, when war
has ceased to be.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But I think it is ordained that for me there
shall be no new glass cupboard.  When I got
back next day, two of them had gone.  I
pinched myself, wondering whether, like some
of the college boys after a night out, I had
been seeing double.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then my friend, the big policeman, told me
he had turned out some well-dressed people
wandering through the ruins after I had left.
It was no common thief who took these little
things.  There were articles of more value
beside them.  No, it was some horrible woman
who coveted a souvenir from the Zeppelined
house, and took what she fancied most.  I
rather wish she had taken the four, then I
might have amused myself by dreaming that
they had been found.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was a mean cold-blooded unsisterly kind
of theft.  It almost deserves to have the
adjective Hunnish attached as a label.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Every day this sad task of mine has been
going on, for more than a week, and now,
tomorrow, this being Sunday, the workmen are
coming in and the removal men, and the few
sticks, at least such as are worth removing,
will be taken away to a furniture hospital
for repair.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Your housewifely soul, already rent, I am
sure, by this recital of my woes will be still
further exercised by a brief description of
what happened to my store cupboard.  It was
very full this autumn, owing to the garden
abundance aforesaid, and our conspicuous
industry and success in bottling, preserving and
pickling,—the shelves simply groaned with
good things, and now it is all one inextricable
sticky mass of jam, and fruit, and broken
glass, and lathe and plaster.  You could not
imagine anything more disgusting.  It is part
of the needless waste of war—a little bit,
however, that just comes right home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Just one more straw, surely the last.  Friend
Government Assessor valued the stock of my
store cupboard at ten shillings, two dollars and
a half.  And I just let him, because it was so
funny, and there didn't seem to be any use
telling him any more about anything.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When I write again I expect it will be all
over and the lid shut down on the place that
was once a home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I sat a little while to-day on the mossy wall
beside the lily pond, one of your numerous
garden thrones.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Do you remember the day they cleaned it
out, and your excitement over the queer little
black fresh water cray fish the men took out
with their hands and laid on the grass while
they swept and scoured the concrete bottom
of the pond?  They crawled about so painfully,
poor things, and if they thought at all, I
suppose they must have imagined it the end of the
world.  Then how pleased you were, and they
too, I expect, when they were put back, and
the lovely clean water from the upper river
ran in on them.  It is very clear to-day, and
there is a crooning sound in the voice of the
waterfall—it sounds almost like a dirge.
Summer is quite gone, and the yellowing leaves
are drifting down everywhere.  Some of them
have camouflaged the horrid burned places the
incendiary bombs made in the grass.  A few
late roses hang about rather wistfully, but
there doesn't seem to be any hope anywhere.
We don't quite know what is going to happen,
whether this house is going to be rebuilt, and
we come back to it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There are immense legal and technical difficulties
in a situation for which no precedent or
legislation exists.  We do not own, but only
lease the property, and at the moment don't
know where our responsibility begins or ends.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Himself is wrestling with the problem, and
the little lines are gathering about his eyes
and mouth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He does not say very much at all, and he
won't go near the North House any more.  I
know he can't bear it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You and I have often talked of how dear
they are, and how they never, never grow up,
but are just boys all their days.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They can do the fighting, but they can't
do the enduring.  That is our bit.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am trying to do mine, all I know how, but
I am hard hit this time, Cornelia.  I am on
my knees.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 4em">

<p class="center pfirst" id="v"><span class="bold large">V</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Such a lot has happened since I wrote last.
I am beginning to regard these letters as a
real and faithful record of this strange phase
of our life.  I know how faithfully you will
keep them as I do yours.  They may come
in handy one day to the person who may gather
up the fragments of my achievement—when
Finis has been written across the last page.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You see, Cornelia, here we have to keep
rather quiet and lift a gallant head—</span><em class="italics">Noblesse
oblige</em><span> has to be the watchword.  This for two
reasons, that so many people require bolstering,
who if they detected any weakening in
this direction would feel that the front line had
broken.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then it is necessary for our inward life.
You know how much I have been through, and
unless I had held my head high right along
why then, it would just have meant the end
of all things.  But oh, how we can be misunderstood!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the dark days of 1910 I met a woman in
the street about three months after the Boy
had passed, and after we had exchanged
greetings she remarked with a charming smile,
"How nice that you have got over it so easily."  My
smile was a little sickly as I replied steadily,
"Yes, isn't it very nice?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I did not see anything very clearly for quite
a while after I had passed on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Just for a moment, I wondered whether it
had been all wrong to bury that irreparable
loss so deep that nobody suspected its
existence, as a loss.  I had been rather proud
because I had been able to "carry on," but
these careless words suddenly awoke in me a
passion of remorse lest I had been disloyal to
his precious memory.  Then I just laughed
weakly as I wiped my nose and eyes.  Am I
not his mother, and do mothers ever forget
or prove disloyal?  Another of "that sort of
person" said to me on the morning of the raid
as I was hurrying to the bank to get some
money, "So sorry; you </span><em class="italics">have</em><span> had bad luck,
haven't you, since you came here?"  Have we,
I wonder?  And what is luck anyway?  You
and I both know there is no such thing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There have been developments since I wrote
you, chiefly regarding our tenancy of the
North House.  It happens that under the terms
of our English lease we are responsible for
this damage, and will have to rebuild for the
proprietor at our own expense.  Preposterous,
you exclaim!  So do we, and Himself has got
his mind firmly made up that he will fight it
out.  Some of our advisers would like us to take
it to the law courts and make a test case of it,
but our adviser-in-chief—that dear friend and
great law lord who made such fun of your
Nipigon fishing story at our big dinner party,
is strongly against it.  He says, "Pay up
whatever it costs.  The case simply bristles with
litigious points and I see it going on indefinitely
and finally coming up before me at the
House of Lords."  Himself is in fighting trim,
however, and the decision will rest with him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Meanwhile we have got to do something
about our future, as we can't go on living in
this furnished house, which gives me the queer
unhappy feeling of not belonging anywhere in
particular.  The kind neighbour who offered
us the shelter had another proposition, that he
should vacate altogether and have us take over
his lease.  We are going to do it, but will have
to wait some time before the transaction is
completed, because we have no furniture
except the broken stuff which is being mended
up at the furniture dealer's in the town.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have to go down almost daily to consult
and decide whether this or that article is worth
repairing.  It usually resolves itself into an
argument with the expert.  The more he says
it can't be done, the more I want it done.  Of
course, it is our dearest treasures that have
received the deadliest damage.  Meanwhile,
my dear, all these matters merely fade into
insignificance beside the one great tremendous
yet glorious fact.  Himself is going to the war.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You know how hard and often he has hammered
on the War Office doors, and how his
age was hurled at him, and he was bidden go
and carry on the good work he was doing in
his own town.  Well, he has got a commission
at last through the intervention of an old
college friend who occupies the exalted position
of A.D.M.S. to a part of the Northern Army.
That means that he is the Director of Medical
Service.  Himself will be attached to the Black
Watch and report himself first to the
Headquarters in Perthshire.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Is he pleased about it?  He does not say
much, but he has been far more restless since
the raid.  Am I pleased?  Cornelia, honestly
I don't know.  Every woman wants her man
to be in this tremendous fight, but I think I
am a little afraid.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Our household is sadly reduced.  Two have
gone to munitions from indoor service, and the
gardeners have been called up.  We don't need
them mercifully, as we have no garden now;
only a backyard.  Life is being gradually
shorn of some of its more dignified material
attributes.  No doubt they are the things that
don't matter, but some of them we loved, and
parting from them hurts.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This morning I read a wonderful verse in
Hebrews.  Every bit of the Bible takes on new
meanings these days.  I can't recall the
chapter at this moment.  I daresay, you will
remember it at once.  "Yet once more, signifieth
the removal of these things that are shaken—as
of things that are made, that those things
which cannot be shaken may remain."  What
do these words mean quite?  Have I been
clinging too frankly to the things that are
made, and must they all go one by one, so that
I may realise and grip the things that cannot
be shaken?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Perhaps that is the war in a nut-shell.  It
is a poignant, almost a terrifying thought.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>He went this morning, Cornelia, New
Year's morning, "in a blast of Januar wind
that blew hansel in on Robin."  He looked
so dear and splendid in his perfect-fitting
uniform (you know he never leaves anything of
that kind to chance and would go without food
any day if the fit of his clothes depended on
it).  I was worshipping all the time and Cook,
our faithful chauffeur, left the car at the door
to come and see whether he could help with
the leggings which were rather stiff and
new—and just to take a general view.  He was the
picture of desolation and woe.  Old servants
don't like those cataclysms.  They have no
reserve weapons to deal with them.  They are
conservative to the innermost fibre of their
being.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At last they drove away to catch the
north-going train at the junction.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have often envied other women when I
heard them speak with conscious pride of their
men at the front—but oh, Cornelia, when the
door was shut and the toot of the horn echoed
faintly in my ears, I forgot to be proud—and
was nothing at all but a lone woman, left
desolate in the house of her dreams.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 4em">

<p class="center pfirst" id="vi"><span class="bold large">VI</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Reconstruction is now my job.  Everything
that could be removed from the wreckage
at the North House has been removed and
the ruins left to the owls and the bats.  The
retrieval was conducted during days of pitiless
rain which accentuated the desolation.  But it
is all accomplished now, and I don't go around
there any more.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We had twenty tons of coal buried in the
debris of the old stabling, where it was housed,
and the police came to tell me it would have
to be removed, if I wanted to get the benefit
of any, as a steady pilfering was going on.  It
was a tremendous job but with coal at its
present price an effort had to be made to get
it out.  It has just been put down in the cellar
of this house and the transfer cost four pounds.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the absence of Himself, I have concluded
the arrangements for an actual possession
of this house, which we have taken for
a term of three years.  No more leaseholds
for me in this country, and though a casually
rented house gives one an odd feeling of
insecurity—anything may happen in three years.
There will have to be a little papering and
painting done, just to make it clean and
wholesome, and then I will bring back my poor
sticks from the repairing shops, and group
them in this strange new setting.  It is really
quite a nice house, with some points the other
lacked.  A great advantage when one has a
depleted staff is a kitchen on the ground floor.
It is a thoroughly bad kitchen, dark and
gloomy, and the hot water arrangements, and
facilities for cooking are positively the worst
I, an experienced housewife, have ever encountered.
If I had not two specimens of the salt
of the earth in these regions beyond, the
situation would be impossible.  They are quite
selfless, as far as their own comfort and
accommodations are concerned.  They think
only of us.  Such personal devotion takes the
edge off many sorrows.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Already I have a scheme which perhaps in
the far future will convert this house into a
real home.  How ineradicable is the instinct
to reconstruct in the human breast!  That it
cannot be killed has been incontestably proved
by the persistence with which our poor French
and Belgian confrères creep back to their
ravaged fatherland and begin again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Himself builded better than he knew when
he began to talk of reconstructing the moment
the shock was over.  He is always distressingly
right in the fundamentals, and our small
internal wars have invariably been caused by my
refusal to admit it.  But life is not all
fundamental, Cornelia, it needs camouflage, needs it
desperately.  All women know it.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>There are gleams of glory.  The finest is
the love of the people for my lover.  A poor
woman rushed up to me to-day to ask the latest
news of him.  From her I learned that they
call him "The Friend of the Poor."  If I were
to die to-morrow, Cornelia, I could ask no
sweeter epitaph.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have decided that the house is not bad at
all, and I am beginning to sit up and take a
little notice.  Only I must not look out of the
back windows.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You remember the enchanting vistas spread
before the green bedroom, and the study
window around the corner.  There was no fret of
the spirit that could not be healed and
comforted, always there was beauty to lift you up,
and a message, no matter how bleak the prospect
elsewhere.  It was that dear intimate kind
of a garden where there was something for
every mood.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Doctor Horton once came to dine and sleep
when speaking at a meeting here, and at six
next morning he was out roaming about, to the
disquiet of the staff.  He had visions of a
hermit's study cell in the ruined tower by the
waterfall, and wondered why I did not
establish a writing room out of doors.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I explained that my writing was a stern
business which would admit of no distractions.
I have found that even a very comfortable
study is a bad place for the cultivation of
thought.  A wooden bench and bare walls, or
the "fender end" of my childhood and a block
on my knee produced the best results.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But to return to the only thing that matters
at the moment.  I am reduced to a cabbage
patch.  Even that is a misnomer, for there is
not even a "Kailyaird runt" i.e. remnant, on
that little ugly bit of mother earth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is a slice of No Man's Land that has
never grown anything but weeds.  It is
relieved by a background of trees, our own
chestnuts, Cornelia, whose glory of pink-and-white
cones we used to watch till they were
mirrored in all their majesty in the clean
depths of the backwater above the fall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When I want positively to revel in heartbreak,
to be homesick and unashamedly miserable
(which I fear I am most of the time, since
Himself retired from the scene), I go to the
uttermost edge of my No Man's Land, where
I can hear the rush and tumble of the waterfall,
though I cannot see its foaming tears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To descend to mundane things, let me
explain that this house belonged to a
master-builder who once upon a time had his
workshop and all the paraphernalia of his business
in the backyard.  After a while he secured
more ambitious premises, and carried away all
the plant, leaving us the legacy of a concrete
floor in the very middle of the patch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So before we can obey the Food Administrator's
order to plant potatoes, the concrete will
have to be broken up and removed by the hand
of George Cook.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>His face was a study when I explained that
as the young doctor preferred to drive the car
himself, his, George's, job would be to make
the desert blossom like the rose.  He looked at
me, and then at it, queerly, with his one active
eye; pulled his forelock with rather a grim
smile, and went forth for a pick.  Inside of an
hour he had started on that task and now the
thud of the pick is the music to which I waken
of a morning.  Sometimes consulting together
(I am beginning to be interested, though I
try not to be), we doubt very much whether
the concrete plus the ineradicable root of an
obnoxious weed called horseradish, will ever
be gotten out in time for a spring crop.  But
Cook is very dogged; and the joy of the
creator is beginning to lay hold on him.  I find it
is a better day's work when I potter round the
patch, sympathising and anathematising turn
about.  Anyhow, the work of reconstruction,
as ordained by Himself, is going forward
cheerfully.  The workmen are in possession of
most of the rooms, and I am just about as
uncomfortable and as busy as the most active
housewife could desire to be.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>My war-work has had to call a halt till I
get through with this business of home making;
that being the duty that lies nearest.  You
think I'm not saying so much as usual about
Himself?  I can't, because, oh, Cornelia, he
seems to have passed out of my life!  I get
his dear letters, but they are all about people
I have never seen and don't want to see,
because they are there with him, seeing him
every day, and I am not.  He is loving the
life—you know how he would—and the boys
with whom he lives in the mess, himself the
biggest boy of all.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In every letter I can sense the buoyancy of
spirit that comes with the laying down of
responsibility.  Here he had so much, and now
he is only a nut in the great machine of war,
and so long as he does his duty and obeys
orders he can have an easy and comfortable mind.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He is stationed at the moment up in what is
the frozen north, but they are the hills of home,
and he is assuredly content.  He is not even
homesick, though always asking when I am
coming.  I am waiting for Effie's next leave,
when we will go up together.  Meanwhile I
must hold the fort here, or all the wrong wall
papers will go up, and there might even be
structural undoing if the workmen were left
to their own sweet wills.  But it is an empty
life, Cornelia, out of which the soul has gone.
Even the picture in uniform, on my desk, the
man of the house at war, fails to afford the
uplift or the comfort once imagined.  I must
get through with this reconstruction job as it
affects material things, and start the
reconstruction of my own inner life.  I, too, must
go to the war.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>I had your dear letter yesterday and have
every word of it by heart, even George's
postscript.  I always knew him to be an
understanding creature, but his knowledge of
human beings, more especially the heart of
woman, is a wee bit uncanny.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Is he your product, Cornelia, or is he just
the American husband at his best?  It is long
since you told me (it was on that wonderful
testing first visit which we essayed fearfully—not
sure whether it would grapple us to one
another with hooks of steel or merely end in a
polite parting with regrets on either side) that
English husbands are not properly brought
up.  You imagined, or really perceived, in
them a lordly air of superiority—and even
said that some of our households bear the
impress of the feudal age in which our race was
cradled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I remember wanting to say that the criticism
did not, and could not, apply to Scotch
husbands.  But perhaps wisely I held my peace.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We left it, what is called in Scotland "a
moot point"—and a moot point, I guess, it
must remain.  Anyway, wherever George got
his knowledge, whether natural or acquired,
he has gripped the essence of this thing when
he calls separation the supreme test of the
bond.  I am going to write to him when I am
through with this, and you are not to see that
letter, nor yet ask to see it—I need him—I
want the man's point of view.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What is this all about anyway?  I think I
hear you say with the uplift of the brows which
is your very own.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You, in America, with your semi-detached
ideas of marriage, which enable you to bear six
months' or a year's separation without any
sinking of heart, or vague questionings, must
naturally find it difficult to realise our point
of view.  With us marriage is "for keeps," as
you say, and when upheaval comes, it seems
always to spell disaster.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Perhaps our theory is all wrong, and an
unwarrantable interference with the freedom of
the individual.  But I can't be happy thinking
of Himself with a whole lot of new interests
I can't share, making shoals of friends, which
is as easy to him as breathing the air, friends
whom probably I shall never see.  He can
guess pretty well what I am about, but I can't
visualise him.  Just think of the hundreds of
wives, and of other women who are feeling
like this, and who are at war with the war,
that has brought it about.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There is another side to the picture, the side
that proves the part truth of your assertion
that we don't bring up our husbands properly.
Let me present a little cameo of the times in
which we live.  I was at a war tea at a
women's club in London the other day, and
there met an old acquaintance I had not seen
for some time.  She was quite middle-aged—and
had been rather dowdy, not paying much
attention to her clothes.  Before I spoke to
her, I was arrested by a subtle change in her
outward appearance.  She had a smart suit
on, and wore a distinctly youthful hat with a
rakish air.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The thing interested me, and I had to find
out its meaning.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When we exchanged greetings she informed
me that her husband, retired, had gone back
to professional work, which meant that he
could not live at home, but at a military
Headquarters.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I sympathised and asked how she got
through the lonely days which I was feeling
so desperately.  She looked at me queerly
through her shrewd candid grey eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, I'm not lonely," she assured me.  "In
fact, </span><em class="italics">entre nous</em><span>, I'm having the time of my
life."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Tell me about it," I asked breathlessly, and
she told——</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, I go out and in as I like, do all
the things I have always wanted to do, but
could not.  Nobody now asks me where I've
been or what I've spent.  In fact, I don't
really think I have any more use for Dan."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There, Cornelia—it will make you smile,
perhaps, but there is a tragedy behind it.
Poor old Dan! comfortable, complacent, no
doubt inflated by a new sense of his own
importance because his country still needs him,
to what strange and hostile atmosphere will
he return!  I can imagine him rubbing his
eyes and wiping his </span><em class="italics">pince nez</em><span> and saying,
"Tut, tut, this will never do!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But he won't be able to put back the clock.
He'll have to march to the new marching tune.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I foresee ructions in the household of Dan.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Meanwhile, she is having the time of her life!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It makes no appeal to me, because I have
always been able to have the time of my life,
as she understands it.  I have gone in and
out without let or hindrance, none daring to
make me afraid.  And now, I am just a lonely
creature like a bit of drift on the shore.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>There is another side to which George calls
the supreme test—a horrible sordid side.
Hear it now.  When I went to France first in
1915, to talk to the boys, I was asked whether
I would go to a small forage camp in a
God-forsaken place away up near Abbeville,
beyond the British Headquarters.  It was a
kind of No Man's Land which nobody ever
visited.  Lectures and concert parties passed
it by.  I said, "Of course I'll go, it is what
I've come out for."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So Effie and I got up at four o'clock in the
morning to catch the only available civilian
train leaving Rouen for "up the line."  The
distance could not be far, according to the
map, but it took us till three o'clock in the
afternoon to get there.  We were shunted into
sidings to let troop trains and ammunition
trains and hospital trains go by, and there
were no passengers in ours except French
officers and other people connected with the war.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>No women, but we two.  I was so thankful
to have Effie.  Her gay inconsequence, her
complete disregard of everything but the great
adventure, helped us over every stony bit of
the ground.  Gendarmes, sentries with fixed
bayonets, grumpy passport and permit
officials—she captured them all.  Youth is quite
invincible, and when its smile is sweet like hers
obstacles melt like mist before the rising sun.
If I had even attempted that wonderful journey
through the war zone without her I should
either have been shot as a spy, or interned for
the duration.  It is short shrift for the
middle-aged and the ordinary beings who can't
explain their business in the area where death and
destiny walk side by side.  Well, in course of
time, through several minor adventures, we
reached our destination.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A sturdy little divinity student from Aberdeen
was holding the fort there for the
Y.M.C.A. and holding it well.  When he went
first to give them a bit of humanizing Christian
comradeship, he had to sleep with a revolver
under his pillow, fully aware that any night
he might get his throat cut.  These men were
not soldiers, though they wore khaki, but
rough east-enders, dock laborers, most of
them, with lawless anarchic blood in their
veins.  They had spent the major part of their
lives rebelling against law and order.  They
were the husbands of some of the women whose
faces broke your heart when I took you to my
big mothers' meeting "down east" two years
ago.  The fortunes of war had cut them off
from the grime and glory of the Barking
Road, and those in authority found them a
tough proposition in that sweet valley in the
pleasant land of France.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We pottered about the camp till nightfall,
when the men gathered into the tent to hear
the woman who had brought them a message
from home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I knew when I stood up in front of them
and saw their faces, looking grim and unrelenting
through the haze of tobacco smoke and
the reek of the oil lamp, that I was up against
something, and would need not only all my art,
but the grace of God to help me through.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But I got them after a bit, got them in the
hollow of my hand—playing on their hearts
with memories of home, though all the time
I knew the kind of homes they had left, and
how hard most of them had made it there for
the women they had vowed to love, honour and
cherish.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When the talk was over they crowded round
and one particularly unattractive person with
a scowling eye inquired whether he could have
a word with me privately.  We managed it
later on in a remote corner, hard by one of the
evil-smelling lamps.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"'Ere, missus," he began.  "Do yer 'appen
to know the Barkin' Road?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I eagerly asserted my complete familiarity
with the Barking Road, the Kings' Highway
to Dockland!  I was even ready to proclaim
it the finest thoroughfare in the world.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"See here, then, Lidy, thet was good talk,
but it don't go far enough.  Maybe I weren't
all I should a bin w'en I was back there, but
my missus she ain't played the game, she's
played it low down on me since I've been in
this 'ere war.  I ain't had no letters from 'er
for over four months, and I carnt 'ear nuthink
about the four kids nah, but a bloke wot lives
dahn our street sends me word that she's sold
up the whole bloomin' shoot and nobody knows
where she is, and the kids is in the Union.  An'
I carnt git out of this blarsted 'ole to see to the
kids and give 'er wot for.  Wot are ye goin'
to do about it, Lidy?"  That was what people
call a tough proposition, Cornelia, the
whole tragedy of one-half of the war in a nutshell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I did what I could.  I tried to comfort him
and took down all the particulars in the note
book already bulging with behests, which it
will probably take me the rest of my natural
life to fulfil.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When I got back to England I made the
inquiries, put the Salvation Army angel on the
track, and found it all just as he described.
His missus has never been found—she has
gone down in the underworld, urged there by
the very same temptations which made Dan's
wife say she had no more use for Dan.
Tasting independence of action and of purse for
the first time, she lost her sense of proportion.
With the well-to-do, it is the sweets of
independence that is testing them—with the other
sort, the lure of the separation allowances,
which means more money in hand than they
had ever dreamed of before in their poor,
narrow, sordid lives.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There's something all wrong with life, Cornelia.
It will have to be straightened out and
evened up, and the poor and the oppressed will
have to taste a little of the glory and the
beauty and the dignity of life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Perhaps that is what the war is for.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Meanwhile the poor bond!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It will have to be recast in the new world
we are coming to.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How many of us will stand the test?</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Himself has been back on his first leave.
It is Sunday night, he has just gone, and the
door is shut again; leaving me inside while he
is speeding away back to the unknown.  It has
been a lovely heartbreaking time.  But he is
detached, Cornelia, he doesn't belong any
more.  I had made superhuman efforts to get
the whole house in order, sitting up late at
night to cover cushions and put in all the
fixings that make the real home.  He was very
polite, looking industriously at everything,
and all the time his eyes were not seeing my
poor little attempts at home-making—but
something else far away.  All he said was, "It's
very nice, but I have all I want in a tent," He
didn't mean to be cruel; he was only gripped
by his new life, saw the mess table with his
comrades round about him—the route march—the
sham attack, all the pomp and preparation
for the real war they are going out to
presently.  The things no woman can share;
or can be asked to share!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is the man's life, the big grey splendid
thing which we are outside of, not once in a
while, but forever and ever.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He has changed, Cornelia—not to me, but
he has gotten the vision of the fierce arena
where men are fighting and dying that Liberty
may live; has not only gotten the vision, but
has become part of it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And I am only the woman left by the fireside.
I don't see the glory of the war as I
used.  The envy I felt towards the women
who spoke proudly of their men at the front
has died utterly.  I don't want him at the
front.  I want him </span><em class="italics">here</em><span> desperately, every
minute of the time.  He doesn't feel like that.
He can do without me.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You said somewhere that since George
heard that Himself has gone, he is, like
Carlyle, "gey ill to live with," cursing the waiting
policy of the President, the everlasting framing
of notes full of dignified protest about
nothing in particular.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He wants to have a hand in the great big
game, I know.  But if the time should come,
soon or late, when your roads and streets shall
resound with the beat of armed and arming
men, put the lid on George.  Never mind how,
but just do it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is hell!</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 4em">

<p class="center pfirst" id="viii"><span class="bold large">VIII</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>I am writing this quite a long way from my
base.  The Black Watch, to which regiment
Himself now belongs, has been sent to the East
coast and I am here in a billet with him for
a few weeks.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is the loveliest old city, interwoven with
all the ancient history, when Flemings and
Danes and all kinds of weird aliens invaded or
flocked to these shores.  It is beloved by your
American tourists; if George and you did not
differ from all American tourists whatsoever,
you would have been here long ago, and could
tell me far more about it than is to be obtained
out of the most authenticated guide book.
You, however, have always preferred to take
your travel in microscopic doses, to make
a little bit your intimate and dear possession
for all time.  I am surprised to find this old
Norwich such a noble city, and I should love
to show you the ancient landmarks.  It is full
of treasures, of values which cannot be told,
or was, rather, for the powers that be have
mysteriously spirited them away, and the
priceless stained glass windows have been
boarded up—the very most priceless of all has
been taken down.  The fate of Rheims and
Louvain and Ypres has made the city fathers
wise.  But it is an omen, Cornelia, which
keeps me awake o' nights and gives me the
jumps when I hear the streets resound with
the tramp of armed men in the silent
watches—Himself having been summoned with the rest
to "stand to" as they call it, with their faces
toward the sea.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The boys have an expression which sums up
these frequent forced marches—they call it
"getting the wind up."  The wind is up here
more often than I like it, and when I hear
quite sober quiet matrons tell what they will
do if the dread moment ever comes when the
Hun invades these shores, I have no strength
in me.  I am not brave at all, Cornelia,
something has been left out of my composition.
This is the most vulnerable part of our
far-flung coast, and there is a great watching army
right along.  Those whose duty it will be to
guide the civilian population in case of
emergency have what you call the schedule ready,
and nothing will be left to chance.  I don't
want to be here when it happens, my dear; this
nameless lurking fear that never sleeps takes
the edge off the joy of being with him.  He
has no belief at all in the landing of German
troops in England.  You know he is an
incurable optimist about the War.  He considers
that we are invincible and that victory is
only a matter of time.  It must be a delightful
atmosphere to live and move and have
your being in; it helps to keep one young.  He
can sleep through anything and only grumbles
when he has not enough of sleep.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>My war experiences are widening.  Yesterday
we had a bombardment from the sea—not
of Norwich, of course—if you remember
your geography you will know that it is not
possible—but of the coast places, Yarmouth
and Lowestoft, less than twenty miles away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I was awakened about four o'clock in the
morning by a dull boom and the sharp rattle
of the windows.  Having lived so much beside
naval guns in our own special Kingdom by
the Sea, I knew exactly what it was and shook
Himself.  "That's naval guns," I said.
"There's a fight going on quite close
by."  "Nonsense," he answered.  "You're
dreaming—go to sleep."  I could not, and rose early
to hear from the little maid, who had heard it
from the milkman, that the coast places had
been bombarded and much damage done.
You know how rumours fly and how disasters
are multiplied and intensified, as they pass
from mouth to mouth.  Himself came back
from the mess with little news beyond the facts,
and I was glad when a friend rang me up to
ask if I'd like to go down to the coast with her
in her car.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Of course I liked it, and we took some of
the bigger children with us—it was Easter
week and they were all at home from school,
round-eyed, eager, fearless about the war,
which to them is nothing but the Great
Adventure.  We hardly expected to get through the
military barrier, but we did, and saw what had been done.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is the same pitiful tale of destruction
which follows in the Zeppelin's track, senseless,
horrible war on defenceless folk who have little
or nothing to protect them.  These delightful
east-coast watering places are all ruined,
because everybody who could afford it has "quit"
as you say, and the boarding houses and hotels
are empty, and will be for the "duration."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was very typically British to find the
front thronged with spectators, women wheeling
babies in perambulators, all gazing upon
the scene, but not apparently frightened at the
wreckage.  The story was soon told.  Some
battle-cruisers suddenly appeared about six
miles out and opened fire for twenty minutes
or so, and then ran.  There was no patrol to
attack them, if it was anybody's business to
be on the outside there, they were off guard.
The only criticism one is inclined to make is
that it could not happen in Germany.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This pleasant East Anglian land is lovely
beyond compare in the exquisite spring
unfolding, but the blight of war seems over all.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They are getting ready great camps nearer
the sea, and the troops will be taken out of
their winter billets.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Himself is very busy inspecting and reporting,
and generally proving as efficient and
thorough in military life as he is in civilian.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I begin to understand the lure of the life.
There is perpetual movement, excitement,
expectation.  There is a certain kind of social
life, lunches and dinners and other entertainment
offered by hospitable people to the incomers,
the great Highland host that has invaded
their stately precincts.  There are lots
of little war brides here with their young
soldier husbands, and maturer matrons, some of
them with considerable families, living in
furnished houses trying to make a bit of home for
the soldier men, and very interested themselves,
though it is all so strange and inconvenient
and far from home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We have delightful rooms in a comfortable
house; it is quite a rest for me, and I am
getting through with my next book.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When they get into camp I shall have to go
back home to the loneliness that is only
companioned by fear.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We are kept in inky darkness here on
account of the frequent air raids.  A month's
imprisonment without the option of a fine is
the sentence for striking a match in the street.
The authorities are lynx-eyed and vigilant,
their reward is that this beautiful old city in
its historic setting has remained immune
through more than a score of attacks from the
air.  It is protected, too, by the trees, which
add so much to its beauty.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It has been an experience, Cornelia, it is all
part of the strange upheaval men call war,
the outward fringes of it only, yet how deeply,
inextricably woven in with the whole woof of
life!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Every day one hears of the most extraordinary
war marriages, rushed into, too often,
after a few days' acquaintance, without a
thought given to the awful indissolubility of
the bond.  For whatever the experience of
matrimony may be like, you can never be as
you were before.  Already there has been much
repenting at leisure, and when the glamour
of the khaki is off, the tragedy will deepen and
enfold the helpless creatures who cannot free
themselves, and have no basis for a future.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There are scandals, too, and tragedies too
deep for tears, broken vows, faithless lovers
and husbands, all the cursed things born of
abnormal situations, and the kind of feverish
false atmosphere created by war.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>These things cry as loud to Heaven as the
blood and sorrow from the battlefields, and
make thoughtful people reiterate the prayer,
Oh, Lord! how long?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They are what we call "after the war
problems."  Some of them will never be
tackled—there is no machinery known to the human
understanding capable of tackling them—many
will just have to be buried deep, and no
cross left to mark the burying place.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There stands out for me here the joy of
comradeship as men understand it, gripping
it to their souls with hooks of steel.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We don't have it, Cornelia—we women, I
mean—it is something we do not get, nor
perhaps understand.  It is not that we are too
petty, but rather, I think, because we have
to keep ourselves more detached and selfless
for all that men need and must have from us,
if the Family is to be held together.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have never seen anything more lovely
than the tie between Himself and the young
officers, these splendid boys, pictures, every
one in their Kilts, and all the panoply of war.
Old enough to be father to any one of them,
he has kept the boy's heart, so that he is
not only with them at the mess, but one of
them.  He is so wise and tender with them,
that they come to him in every trouble.  It
makes me weep, and yet feel so proud, but
not in the least surprised.  Did I ever tell you
about the bundle of letters, docketed, dated
and tied up, I found among the Boy's things
after he went away?  His father's letters—which
revealed to me a side of Himself I had
never seen.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They ought to be printed, but I suppose
other fathers write the same kind of letters to
their sons at schools, letters that help the
sensitive young souls to grapple with the
mysteries of life.  It is all part of their
nature—the bit that isn't ours—comradeship between
man and man!  When found between father
and son, it is the most beautiful thing in life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You will be stunned by the news of Kitchener's
passing.  It created a panic here among
the common folk.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I met a woman in the street, with a crushed
copy of the evening paper under her arm,
wringing her hands and crying out that "all
was lost."  It shows what a hold he had upon
the popular imagination.  His has been, and
is, a name to conjure with.  The product of his
vast personal magnetism is on every fighting
front, and in every training camp at home.
He was a great man—but his work was
done—others will reap where he has sown.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The memorial services in the Cathedral here
were fitting and fine, massed and muffled
bands, a dense crowd of khaki-colored men.
Generals and high military personages galore,
all the pride and pomp of war.  But Kitchener
will live in the hearts of the people—his true
memorial is to be found in the serried rows of
crosses in France and Flanders where so much
of the army he called into being lies in
consecrated dust that is "forever England."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am back again in old Hertford to find
letters urging my return to France.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is sweet to hear, not only from Effie, who
says it in almost every letter from Camiers,
but from those in authority, that the boys are
always asking when I am coming back.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The time-limit is the difficulty—everywhere,
but more especially in the war zone, the
restrictions are growing in intensity, and
permits for foreign service to civilians are now
almost impossible to obtain.  If I agree to
stay three months, I can go to-morrow, but
how can I leave home for three months, as
long as Himself is still on this side of the
water, liable to come on leave any day, or even
just to say good-bye before he sails?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I can't do it, so I am compromising by
agreeing to go for a spell to the home camps.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Winchester Command has asked me for
a month and I'll try to put in a part of it soon.
Effie is due on leave immediately, but she is
finding conditions changing too at her base.
What has happened is that all the butterflies
and the undesirables, out merely for a new
sensation, have been weeded out and only the
solid workers remain.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The plague of women" that tormented the
military authorities during the Boer War and
created endless problems in South Africa has
been more drastically dealt with in this war.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I wish I could tell you all the things Effie
has told me, but there is a certain reticence to
be observed, and amid so much that is fine and
noble why insist or dwell upon the flaws?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You asked about Florence in your last letter
and I gave her your message.  Daily I thank
God for my faithful servant and friend who
cares for me so tenderly, and is so understanding
of all the trials of this changed, unnatural
life.  She is part of the House of Defence—the
shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
She has three brothers in the war.  One who
had been frightfully wounded about the head
and face came back convalescent the other day
and I saw him here.  I was afraid to go into
the kitchen, knowing what the nature of his
wounds had been, but so cleverly, wonderfully,
had he been handled by these heaven-born
surgeons who repair the waste and wreckage of
war that he looked much as of yore, though
with some deep scars where part of a new jaw
had been grafted on.  He was very quiet, as
those are who have been long in the midst of
unspeakable things, but when I asked him
whether he was willing to go back, he just
smiled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There is nothing else to be done," he
answered.  "And there's the regiment and the
pals."  That is the spirit of Kitchener's Army—the
spirit that lives after him, and which
will bring the victory.  It makes one proud
to be alive and to belong to the old flag.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Picture me then, Cornelia, carrying on as
bravely and steadily as may be, a little rocky
and homesick at times, but yet following, if
afar off, in the track the boys have outlined
and worn by the tramp of their brave unflinching
feet.  To be worthy, not only of those who
have died to keep us safe and free, but of those
who have been maimed and wrecked for us in
the summer of their days, and have still to live
with their cross upon them—that is the charge
laid upon the rest of us, by the God who is
watching the conflict from His secret place,
biding His hour to strike.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>The grip of war is tightening in on our
little Island, Cornelia.  Soon it will be relentless.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As I was standing this morning with Florence
in our sadly diminished and attenuated
store cupboard she said in her simple direct
way, "Do you notice that every day there is
a little less, something else we have to do
without?"  It was apropos of the plum puddings
and the mincemeat, now due to be made, but
for which there are no ingredients.  A good
many households in England and Scotland
depended upon our Christmas puddings.  I hate
to have them go short, but diplomatic relations
being what they are with Tino of Greece, we
have no currants.  It is thus we visualise and
realise the intimate discomfort of a world at
war.  It has all to be cheerfully faced,
however, and we talked substitutes for a good half
hour, and there will be a pudding of some sort
to go forth to the waiting households, though
it will be minus the plums.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Since I wrote you last I have been to Scotland.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>War has shaken the foundations of our
Kingdom by the Sea.  It has ceased to be a
haven and become in very truth a coast defense.
The cliffs bristle with guns, they have
crept up from the fort, till the nearest one is
over the garden wall not fifty yards away.
There it stands with its gleaming nozzle to
the sea, the gunners unsleeping night and day
by its side.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It has become horrible and menacing.  Its
old-world intimate charm, which belongs to
simple places untouched by conventionality,
has surely gone, forever sacrificed, as so much
else has been, to the monster that has convulsed
the world.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When we could not keep the Boy we laid
him here in the place he so loved—and it was
a crumb of comfort in our sorrow to feel that if
he had been given choice he would himself have
chosen to sleep on the windy hill above the
shore where in his childhood days he used to
paddle with his fat brown legs, and his bucket
gripped hard in his podgy little hands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As I sat there by his white cross on the
windy hill and listened to the beat of the surf
on the rocks below, I wondered what he was
thinking of it all, and I felt glad that his dear
dust was sleeping sweetly, his soul safe in
the Father's House.  I think I must tell you
here, my soul's friend, of a strange story I have
had sent to me from France, a story which
affects me and mine.  The Boy had his father's
genius for friendship, and clung to his chums
with all the ardour of his nature.  I lost sight
of his chief one when Oxford swallowed him.
In a busy life like mine there is not time to do
all the things one wants to do.  The garden
of friendship even has to suffer through the
lack of cultivation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This chum was starting what promised to be
a brilliant professional career when the war
threw him into the vortex.  As a young
lieutenant of the Engineers he crossed to France
and received his death wounds at La Bassée.
I was in France at the time and could so easily
have found him in the hospital among the sand
dunes near Wimereux, only I did not know.
I did not even see his name in the </span><em class="italics">Times</em><span>.  You
know we don't read the lists so carefully now,
most of us are afraid.  After a time I got a
letter from his mother telling me how he had
died.  He had lingered three weeks, suffering
no pain, fully aware that he could not recover,
ready to die as he had lived, without fear,
bravely, as brave men only can and do die.
His mother was with him to the end.  I am not
sure whether I envy her.  Mine went in a flash
without pain or warning, or possible shrinking,
straight from one home of love to another.  It
must wring a mother's heart to watch the
candle flickering out so slowly.  She wanted to
be with him night and day, but he always urged
her to leave him at night; both because she
never slept and he was better alone.  She was
very sad until he said one night, "Do go
mother, I am never lonely you know, for when
you go, Ned comes.  He is here all the
time—and I want you to know he's waiting for me
and I'll be all right over there."  All right over
there!  God, how beautiful it is, and how it
comforted me to feel that my son is no more
lonely in the Father's House.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Those things are not figments of the imagination,
Cornelia—the veil is very thin, and the
Lord Christ Himself walks with these dear
lads and shows them the way home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am glad they are both out of it now—safe
forevermore.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>My sister, Janet, whom you never met, and
who has so long cared for our summer home,
is no longer able.  She has never really
recovered the shock of the Boy's passing—and
though she stoutly denies it, the strain of the
war had told on her very much.  She must have
a rest and get away for a while from the guns
of the coast defence.  So we have let the house.
Conceive it, Cornelia, if you can—strangers
living and sleeping and possessing our
Kingdom by the Sea!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The house the children loved best of all the
houses in the world is now in military possession!
How truly Florence touched the spring
when she said, "Every day there is something
to be given up."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If it means helping to win the war, if it can
be won no other way than by giving up all we
are and have, why then let us in the name of
God do it gladly, with high heads and shining
eyes in which there are no tears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is liberty and love we fight for.  If they
are slain, what will be left?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>My sister has come here to be with me for
some months.  I am disquieted about her.  She
looks frail, and she has lost the old buoyancy
and wit.  Now that she can rest for the first
time in her life, the desire to rest has passed.
It is all so pathetic and so typical of the stern
discipline we call life.  We really are in the
fighting line from the cradle to the grave.  I
smiled this morning looking back to when I
said it was necessary to take her out of the
strain of the Coast Defence.  Because she has
come into the real war zone here, and last
night got a taste of invasion from the air.  I
must tell you about it because, though we have
had many attacks from the air during the last
year, this one stands out.  We brought one
of the raiders down—a mass of flaming
wreckage—an awful but a glorious sight.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have sometimes wished I could have you
come here to share one of our Zeppelin nights,
to feel the thrill of tense fear which seizes the
bravest when the warning sounds, to run with
us to shelter, and live the long hours of strain
and terror through.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I forget whether I told you that we have
very good cellarage in our Chinese Chippendale
house and that we accommodate about 20
or 30 less fortunate neighbours while the
danger is most imminent.  Florence takes special
pride in the cellar; she keeps it very clean and
snug, spreads old rugs and sets out the garden
chairs.  Then there is an oil stove and various
wraps for the cold nights.  It can be very cold
in a cellar about 3 A.M. when one's vitality
is at its lowest ebb, and fear lurks in every corner.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Some of the women bring their knitting and
the mechanical exercise helps to allay nervous
distress.  A woman I met one morning after
a raid said she had been out buying dusters for
her Zeppelin guests to hem in their forced
seclusion.  Of course it is the gregarious instinct
which brings them together; danger seems less
awful somehow when it is shared.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I don't know whether they notice how short
a time I spend under ground—I never sit down
there.  I want to be up and out if possible,
facing the danger, of which I am yet mortally
afraid.  I don't fancy death in a cellar and I
fear I am like the tommies, a fatalist as
regards bullets and bombs.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But I'm digressing shamefully.  The warning
came about seven, and just before nine,
we heard the grating of the engines up aloft.
It was so loud we thought there must be two
or three, but we could not see anything.  They
went straight over London, approaching as
usual from the North, and just missing us.
They dropped a good many bombs, and the
air was full of the noise of bursting shells, and
the clatter of our anti-aircraft guns.  Shrapnel
was flying from them, even over our little town,
and safety was only to be found indoors.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>About midnight the marauders began to
retrace their steps, if I may put it so, and
came right overhead.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then we beheld a wonderful and glorious
sight.  Our intrepid airmen, just like great
gadflies winging through the night, were
searching the sky for the enemy and presently
one got above the stationary Zeppelin and
found the range.  It looked as if they were
directly above the church opposite to us, but
the actual conflict took place in the air about
8 miles away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When he got the range he showed a green
light, a signal to the anti-aircraft guns below
to cease firing.  We could not hear the shot
that made an end of the monster, but presently
we saw vivid streaks like forked lightning run
along the side of the giant airship.  The next
moment, a mass of white flame, it toppled over
and began slowly to descend.  The cage
became detached first and those who were near
enough saw the body of its unfortunate
occupant fall from it.  It descended in a field
behind the doctor's house at Potter's Bar, and
such a cheer rent the air, ringing hoarse from
a million throats, from London to the sea, that
one felt positively thrilled, and forgot the night
of fear.  Some wept and some sang "God Save
the King."  The great solid satisfying fact
that the death-dealing monster had been
utterly destroyed sent us thankful to our beds.
These awful happenings have their comic as
well as their tragic side, and even with nerves
strung to the highest pitch we are able to laugh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We had the Holbrooks for the week end—the
whole four of them.  He is a typical John
Bull, and he was much annoyed because a very
keen game of bridge was interrupted.  He
resented the interference with his liberty and
personal convenience.  Nothing on earth
would take him to the cellar, he simply planted
himself with a very long pipe and a whiskey
and soda in the library, where he sat with a
suffering air, what we call the "O Lord, how
long?" expression on his face.  His women
folk, thrilled and interested, for though they
live in London their area has so far escaped
intimate acquaintance with Zeppelins, could
not be brought in from the street.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Holbrook is just as amusing in her
way as her spouse.  Born in England of German
parents, she is loyal to the core, and
rejoices that she has never even seen Germany.
She loathes the war and all it stands for, and
she will never give her son until she is obliged
to; she is the living personification of the line,
"I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier."  She
can't understand, though she is a dear soul, the
thrill and the pride with which we can give
and give and give, not money, but our heart's
blood till there is nothing left.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is the waste of war which terrifies her.
You see, she has no hope or belief in anything
beyond this life.  She just shakes her head if
you speak to her of the souls that are marching
on.  "I hope you're right," she says, "but I
don't believe it myself, when I am dead there
will be an end of me; that's as far as I've got."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How awful to have to live up against such
a blank wall—no wonder she clings to the
material body of her son with frantic hands that
will never let him go.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We got through the night at last, snatched
an hour or two's sleep, and in the morning went
over to Potter's Bar in the motor to see all that
was left of the monster of the air.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The pretty little village swarmed with
people "out for to see" just as our town swarmed
with them when we got our share of attention
from Count Zeppelin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We tramped through indescribable mud to
the sweet meadow where the wreckage lay;
partly caught in the branches of a giant oak
tree—then trailing away across the sward like
the tail of some enormous rattlesnake.  We
did not see the engines—they had been
removed in the small hours on a military truck.
What we did see was the retrieval of the
bodies from the wreckage—poor charred
objects—perfectly unrecognisable.  Mothers'
sons every one, and somewhere in Germany
their homes will be desolate because they do not
return.  I thought of that, but the temper of
the crowd was hostile and bitter, and the
feeling uppermost was grim satisfaction that they
had met a righteous and deserved doom.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>More of the dark fruits of war, the tempering
and hardening of a naturally kindly people
into a thirst for revenge.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>God send it may end soon—before we are
all so changed that we shall bear no semblance
to our former selves.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>I seem to have reached the end of my letter
just about the time I wrote to you last and
the doctor, whom in the absence of Himself,
I had to call in, ordered me to go away and
take a complete rest—you know the formula—but
dear God, how can we rest in a world
where there is no rest, and with the thunder
of the guns in our ears night and day.  It is
the Somme fighting now, in which we have lost
so many of those we love.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I think I gave up the day I got a telegram
telling me Dick had been killed at Trones
Wood.  You remember Dick, and Isabel, that
lovely pair for whom I wrote the little book,
"Letters to a War Bride."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I don't quite know how to tell you what he
was like—a most gallant gentle Knight
without fear and without reproach—yet so full of
fun, that somehow laughter sang in the heart
wherever he came—the laughter that doeth
good like a medicine.  The last time I saw
him, Isabel had come down from Palace Gate
to spend a few days and Dick came marching
through with his Fusiliers, en route from
Colchester to France.  He and his Major dined
with us—and I never saw him again—nor ever
will see him now, till we meet on the other side.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>No doubt we are naturally drawn towards
those whom nature has richly endowed.  He
was as handsome as a dream—tall, dark with
flashing tender eyes and a smile that was never
far away from his lips.  A man of peace if
ever there was one, yet he was dedicated to
war, in order that peace may be established
for all time as "one of those things that
cannot be shaken."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They were a beautiful pair; she with her
slender, delicate charm, her braids of red gold
hair, her pathetic eyes.  I have never seen
such love.  It often made me afraid.  And
now he sleeps there on the Somme where we
have already left ninety thousand like him.
Great God, and yet there are those who ask
when Britain is going to come into the war and
why she doesn't bear her share!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I felt I had to go to her, but she was far
away at her father's place in Scotland and I
was not able to go.  My marching orders were
drastic.  Himself ordered me to Harrogate,
where he said he would come the moment he
could get forty-eight hours' leave.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So I got me ready, and Janet went part of
the way, branching off at York, for Hull.  I
arrived at Harrogate like a person in a dream,
seeking a cure.  A cure from what?  Inside my
heart were wounds for which there never could
be any cure this side the grave.  I found I
was nearer the breaking point than I knew,
for when I got to bed there I found I was not
able to get up again.  The heart had gone
clean out of me.  I remember Himself arriving
from out of some void at six o'clock in the
morning, and his face as he stood over me
asking me questions, taking temperatures and
doing all the things the Doctor has to do when
he is up against his job.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then there were consultations and
telephones and people coming in and out of the
room.  Strange men asking questions and
looking at me, and at one another, with grave
faces.  I seemed so out of it all, and when I
heard them say outside of the door, "We'd
better tell her," something flashed through me
with a thrill of unexplicable, inconceivable
joy.  I had come to the end, the door was ajar,
and I should get away clean and forever from
the fever and the fret—the holding up when
you feel yourself wilting, the carrying on when
there is nothing to carry on with.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Tired?  There is no word that can begin to
describe how tired I was.  Then they came in
and told me I should have to have an operation
immediately—within an hour or two.  I just
smiled and said, "Very well."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The next thing I was being carried down
the hotel stairs on a stretcher to the ambulance,
where they laid me down rolled in a blanket—a
nurse was at the head and Himself sitting
like a grim sentinel at the foot—we never
spoke to one another, not a single word.  You
have never seen him look like that, Cornelia—you
have only heard his laugh, and seen his
dancing eyes, while he tried to tease you and
to imitate what he called the Yankee twang.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As for me my eyes were fixed on the tender
blue of the sky—flecked with those wonderful
delicious little fleecy clouds like foam flakes on
an azure sea, and all the time I wondered
whether soon I would be up and away beyond them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was to a private hospital they took me
and I had to lie in a weird kind of bed there till
the hour came.  I had no fear or apprehension—I
had just given up.  Himself and I did not
talk.  When you have been so long together
surely everything has been said.  But I saw
his face hard and set and sharp in the clear
light, and understood that the bond had stood
the test.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The operation was successful, but when I
awoke and found I was still in the land of the
living, I wept with sheer disappointment.  I
had relaxed my hold, given up, wanted to be
free.  But apparently there is work still to
be done, but where, oh where, am I to find
strength to do it?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Convalescence in pleasant surroundings is
a kind of lotus land and I have a sympathy I
had never felt before for the women who
acquire what Himself calls the "nursing Home
habit."  The utter lack of responsibility,
submission to the will of others; complete
surrender of one's entity has its private and
particular lure for the human soul.  To eat and
sleep and get well is a simple creed enough,
but it is apt to have a corroding effect.
Sometimes I had the awful feeling that I should
never be able to go back to the real world and
begin the fight all over again.  I read much
and was able to give my full attention to
"Mr. Britling Sees It Through."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It impressed me so much that I wrote a long
letter to H.G. and had a very characteristic
reply.  He is taking himself as seriously as
ever, and all the world is called to witness the
evolution of his soul.  I have been watching
it for quite a long time.  To us who are veterans
on the road it seems all a little crude and
pathetic.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nevertheless it is one of the finest books of
the war that has been written.  I expect you
have already read it—tell me how it strikes
you?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Himself, restored to his normal courage and
cheerfulness, came and took me home.  His
commanding officer has been very decent to
him through it all, and has not grudged nor
forbidden the necessary leave.  I was about a
week alone before Effie came and she is going
to stay this time till I am quite well.  We have
all sorts of plans.  It all ended in our going
to Bournemouth to get out of the air raid zone
and enjoy the sunshine of the south coast.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The place was very full and though it was
quite safe from the air alarms—everywhere we
met wounded and broken men, blinded men,
and those wearing on their faces the look of
those who have seen and known.  And it was
there at Bournemouth that we got the glad,
the glorious news that you had come in.  We
did not know how badly we had wanted it, how
near we were to the breaking point till the
message which has transformed the whole
world was flashed across the seas.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We were at Boscombe and the Nicolls at the
Bath Hotel at Bournemouth.  When we met
that night I was struck by the expression on
Sir William's face even more than by anything
he said.  He looked like a man from whom
the cloud had been lifted and who could once
more breathe freely.  He knows all there is
to know about the war and when I saw the
effect the momentous decision had upon him, I
seemed to realise how much had depended on
it.  All he said was "Thank God, America has
come in!"</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>I wanted to send a cable to George and the
only thing I could think of was "Hail
Columbia!"  Effie remarked, "It will be nice and
cheap."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This has narrowed the dividing seas and I
am seeing you and George and all the other
Georges and Cornelias who care, holding a
jubilee.  Nothing seems to matter now—however
long the war lasts, we can see it out.
Though the way may be uphill to the very end,
we can climb it to the victory peaks—companioned
by your strength and sympathy and substantial help.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am so glad about it I can't sleep.  Effie
has just made a little sketch of Uncle George
receiving the news; it is a disrespectful sketch,
but I'm putting it in.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>I got your delightful letter yesterday.  It
came at the psychological moment when I was
right down in the depths.  It was a friendly
true hand stretched across the dark void.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It has happened, Cornelia; Himself has
gone beyond my ken in the troop train and
the troop ship, across the seas.  It came, as all
the marching orders do, without warning or
preparation.  He was simply told to be ready
for embarkation in forty-eight hours—destination
Egypt—not France or Flanders, but
away to the Orient, from whence come no leave
trains.  How often have I stood on the
platform at Victoria or Charing Cross to bid some
comrade good-bye; and been thrilled by the
poignant tenseness of the hour, the glory and
the humour and the pathos of it.  Saying
good-bye to a pal, however good he may be,
is not the same as saying good-bye to your
very own, every hair of whose head is dear.
There was no glory nor humour for me that
day at Waterloo, though Ronald Robertson of
the gallant Gordons did his best to provide
both, with his crutches and his merry smile.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I told you how he had lost his leg at Loos;
a boy to whom legs meant so much.  All he
says is that he would give the other one, too,
if it would do them any good.  How are you
to even </span><em class="italics">think</em><span> of your own sorrow in the face
of a devotion so invincible, so divine?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We were a little company of close friends
to see Himself go off; no woman dare go
through that ordeal quite alone.  It was an
officers' train, some of them so very, very
young, and so pathetically proud to be really
going at last in all the panoply of war, with
the addition of brand new pith helmets
which extinguished their features when they
put them on, and made them look like
overgrown mushrooms.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was the usual hustle and delay, but
at last the signal blew and the snorting engine
dragged them away to the tunnel which swallowed
the hearts of half the women left behind.
It was an awful moment, just black darkness
that could be felt.  There is something wrong,
Cornelia, something terribly wrong with a
world in which such things are possible.
People can't have been meant to suffer so much,
yet somehow I feel that we have not come to
the end of the pain yet.  It is Calvary we are
coming to, and this is only getting us ready.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Himself said very little.  He just looked
wrung and asked some one in a very quick,
hoarse voice to take care of me.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So he is away out into the void, the biggest
void of all, and I am left to fill up and carry on
as best I can.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Your dear letter has turned my thoughts
into an entirely new direction.  George's
summing up of your feverish war activities in
America as "getting restless in your sleep" is
really fine.  Tell him with my love that I did
not think he could have evolved it from his gay
inner consciousness.  What I am absolutely
sure about, is that there is nothing feverish or
casual about </span><em class="italics">his</em><span> war activities.  I shall
expect to receive a photograph of him in
uniform.  Age?  What is Age?  It doesn't
count in this war.  The uniform took ten years
off Himself's age and he will see that they are
kept off.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I know a man, one of our County magnates,
who has given four sons to the war.  Two have
been killed, one still fights and the last has been
invalided out and given a military post at home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man, seventy, if he is a day, has got
himself taken on somehow, and in ranker's
uniform acts as his Colonel Son's orderly and is
very particular about the salutes!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Love of country is ageless, thank God;
Himself thinks before we are through every
veteran will have to take his stand.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Don't get worried, because you seem to be
going slow.  Of course, what you tell me in
confidence is a little disappointing.  We did
think you were quietly getting ready before
the clarion call was sounded.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Well, never mind, you will soon get a move
on.  You are such a tremendous big brother.
When you really get into fighting trim the
earth, to say nothing of the Kaiser, must tremble.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Tell George to write to me without fail
whenever he gets back from Washington.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I should love to come out to you now, but
there is so much to do here and so few to do it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am now strong enough to get into harness
again and have been doing quite a lot of
talking at the camps and ammunition works.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The other night, I had rather a curious
experience.  They asked me if I would go down
to a big shell factory, almost entirely manned
by women, and speak to the squad on the night
shift.  I ought to explain a little about the
women working in Munitions.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They are not ordinary factory hands nor
even all working girls.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When the urgent call went out that thousands
of women were needed to make the implements
of war and stand as a rampart behind
the fighting men, the response came from
all classes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I know hundreds of women who formerly
only knew work as something they paid other
people to do, who are now cheerfully standing
on their feet twelve hours a day with intervals
for meals; living side by side in horrid little
communal villages with girls from the East
End and the slums, and who give all they earn
to the war funds.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Further, they are happier than they have
ever been in their lives.  They have found the
key to one of the finest paradises available to
humanity, and are proving work to be a
panacea for almost every sorrow.  I don't think
they are going to lose that key any more.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But though it is all very fine, the first time
I was in real big munition works and saw these
heads—some of them such pretty heads—bent
over the machines, I rebelled, just as I
sometimes rebel over Effie's youth being spent in
the drudgery of the French war zone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>For we are only young once, and for youth
there is no substitute.  You have to grip
yourself hard sometimes when you are overwhelmed
by the sight of womanhood dedicated to the
work of destruction and ask what it all means.
God made us creators, builders, conservers,
and the waste and cruelty of war is opposed to
the very basic principles of our being.  Then why?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Just because there is one thing worse than
war, a dishonourable peace based on selfishness,
and love of ease, and shirking of responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I had the same feeling always when I had
to stand up in the huts in France before the
units of the First Hundred Thousand and it
was only by gripping myself tight and holding
on to the great ideals they stood for, that I
had the courage to say anything to them at all.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The spirit is fine among the women
munitioners but sometimes they get tired and
discouraged and long for the old sweet peace of
home, and the cheerful comradeship of the
fireside.  It is then that the welfare superintendents,
watching with unsleeping vigilance, call
to the helpers outside to come and do their bit.
I was to speak to them at the lunch hour, half
past two in the morning, just to remind them
that they are in the trenches too and that they
must stand solid and unflinching behind the
men who are laying down their lives for us.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I was walking to and fro on the great floor
of the factory and had just paused to ask a
rather white, sad-faced girl what was worrying
her, when suddenly the lights went out.  We
knew what that meant, all of us, and it really
was one of the most awful moments I have
ever experienced.  As we listened through a
silence that could be felt, the machinery
having stopped as if by magic, we could hear the
sinister grinding of the Zeppelin engine
overhead.  We all knew that if a bomb crashed
through the frail roof very few of the four
thousand would see another dawn.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Presently nerves began to break a little; a
sob sounded here and there, and once there
was a little scream.  Then some angel in a far
corner, guided from above, no doubt, began to
sing low and softly, "Jesus lover of my soul."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have heard many lovely heart-breaking
things, Cornelia, but never anything that
thrilled like that.  It reminded me a little of
your Jubilee singers who came over with
Moody, the Evangelist, so long ago from your
country.  When they sang "Steal away to
Jesus," it had the same grip and thrill as it
came stealing across the vast arena, taken up
by almost every voice.  The effect was instantaneous;
it fell like Balm of Gilead on our terrified hearts.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We suddenly felt that God was over all, and
that unless He permitted, nothing could
happen.  Nothing did happen.  After a time the
menace passed, lights went up again and work
was quite quickly and cheerfully resumed.  We
did not speak about it at all afterwards.  It is
just part of the day's work.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I saw something quite as fine when I went
to Gretna for a five-day visit to the workers
there.  You know Gretna Green?  Every
good American does.  It is one of the shrines
at which you worship.  The sweet old world
village has been swept away, or rather become
quite unrecognisable.  A great new city like
those to which you are so accustomed "out
West" has sprung up.  When I saw all the
signs and symbols of organised industry on a
gigantic scale, I looked away across the
shifting Solway sands and wondered whether the
ghost of Ravenswood, riding to his doom, ever
comes back to marvel at the thing that has
happened.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Great crowds of women and girls are
employed there and the welfare superintendents
have their hands full.  The problems and
grave menace to youth segregated in such
numbers far away from home influences are
big enough to keep some of us awake at nights.
We are fully alive to them and tackle them
with all the wisdom and foresight we can
muster for the gigantic task.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The spirit is fine—patriotism is a holy fire
indeed which can purge the human heart clean
of the dross itself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I spoke a big incontrovertible truth in
answer to a woman who was condoling rather
profusely on the loss of our dear home.  "You can
get another house, but there is only </span><em class="italics">one</em><span> country."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There are several rows of danger shops at
Gretna, where the most inflammable of all the
high explosives is handled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To minimise the loss in case of accident
these shops have been made to accommodate
only ten or twelve workers.  There was an
explosion when I was there, and some of the
workers were killed.  The girls behaved with
such quiet courage and endurance that one
can hardly speak about it without tears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And every one of them insisted on being sent
at once into another shop to take the same
risks all over again.  The true war spirit
which danger and death only deepens and
intensifies.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But oh, Cornelia, more and more I feel that
it is all wrong.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If only all this splendid force could be dedicated
to construction, instead of to destruction,
why then our social vices and problems
would melt like mist before the morning sun.
But perhaps my vision is limited, so that I do
not see far enough.  Perhaps we are building
better than we know in the midst of this
mighty débâcle.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Perhaps, who knows,—the work of national
reconstruction through the discipline, the
sorrow and the pain of its individual units has
already begun.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Your last letter gave me so much to think
about, that I have had to put off answering it
day after day.  Have you observed that those
who wait for the convenient season, never,
somehow come up with it?  The time to
answer letters is when you get them, though
there may be some danger lurking in that
admirable habit.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>For instance, if you get one which causes
your dander to be "riz," it is better to wait for
the cooling process.  Disasters have been
averted, especially in business, by the counsel
of patience.  How often have I had to get
surreptitious hold of letters written by Himself
and keep them over till he said, "I wish I
hadn't sent that.  Why did you let me?"  Then
I produce it and all is well.  But
sometimes I have been too late, or he wouldn't let
me intervene.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then sometimes it was the right thing for
the bomb to be thrown.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Peace at any price is not the best always;
it can be the very worst.  And now he is away
where there are no letters to answer, not even
mine.  I haven't had a message of any kind
for six weeks—I don't even know where he is.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We live through these things.  Thousands
of women are eating their hearts out all over
the world, just as I am.  It is the price of war.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What you tell me about your Anne fills me,
not with your disquiet, but with an understanding
sympathy.  You are feeling a little as I
felt when I realised that for a time I had lost
the Boy.  The period extended over quite a
few years from the second year of his school
life.  The first year he was nothing but a
homesick little chap, needing his mother
dreadfully.  Then he began to stiffen up, his
father standing like a comrade by his side.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I never got him back, Cornelia, not as I had
him once.  He went out very soon into the
world of men, and the things he met there I
could not share.  No woman can.  When a
man fails his young son during those moulding
years of destiny, there is no retrieval.  It is
the greatest failure in history or in life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mine did not fail his son, and I stood by a
little wistfully sometimes, bolstering my heart
with a vision of the days to be, when the grown
man, a child at heart, would creep back to his
mother's arms.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But the day never came.  I don't mind now,
for he belongs to me so utterly.  Himself gave
him up the day we laid him on the windy hill
above the sea; a chapter of his life that was the
most radiant had </span><em class="italics">Finis</em><span> written across the page.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But I got my baby back, and can never lose
him again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You must not worry too much about Anne.
Girls pass through quite as many phases as
their brothers and some of them are more
tiresome.  The only child is an object for
commiseration rather than for envy.  Growth can
be retarded, sometimes even stopped, by over
cultivation.  Anne has had too much waiting
on, too much anxiety and sheltering care
lavished on her.  She is the product of intensive
culture.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But her nature is so sweet and wholesome
that she'll come out on top yet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Of course the very best thing that could
happen to her, would be to marry a comparatively
poor man and have a lot of children,
certainly not less than six.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I think I see you gasp, but Cornelia, in
these words lie hidden one of the first
elemental truths of existence and of happiness.  It
is what we were made for—to be mothers of
men, and when for one reason or another we
miss, or shirk that high destiny, we have got
to pay the price.  What can match the flowers
of the field for beauty and strength? Their
sweetness is flung ungrudgingly on a desert
world; no man prunes, or trains or troubles
about them; they are the children of mother
earth and greatly do her credit.  We shall
have to get back to old primeval simple things
where the big issues are concerned.  The
family, not the solitary child, but the healthy,
sturdy row, "steps and stairs," as we used to
call them, will have to become, as of yore, the
basic column of our national life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The war which has torn at the very roots of
our vaunted civilisation has revealed to us the
canker.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Anne is being as tiresome as a self-willed
girl of seventeen can be, and that is saying
much.  You see they know everything at that
age, and nobody else knows anything.  Parents
are back numbers, their only function to
provide the setting for the soaring ambitions,
through which seventeen aims at self-realisation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I don't think there is much you can do at
this juncture.  If she had been but two years
older, I should have asked you to ship her over
here and I would have taken her to France.
I expect to go there next month.  If she could
be beside Effie and do a bit of honest work, the
more sordid and unattractive work the better,
she would get something of a perspective.
When my girl went out first and I was very
anxious, a wise man and true friend said:</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Now you must leave Effie alone.  You
have done all you can.  Let Destiny do the
rest."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It comforted me mightily and I have honestly
tried to follow his advice.  It isn't easy.
I am one of the candid outspoken kind of people,
and I never see any reason for not talking
about what interests me.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But Himself and Effie don't talk.  Half the
time you never know what they are thinking or
meaning to do.  I suppose they know themselves,
only they don't feel the need of sharing
things.  Once when particularly exasperated,
I informed Himself he ought never to have
been married, as he would have been a success
as a Swiss Family Robinson, without the
family, quartered on a desert island.  He just
smiled and made no comment.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A friend of mine, married to a very
distinguished man, whose name I daren't mention,
said to me once: "It is quite possible to love
your husband dearly and yet to want
frequently to throw him out of the window."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have just had an interruption from a
woman who runs one of the camp tents here—an
awful kind of woman, who never stops
talking about herself for a moment.  When
she went away she thanked me for our pleasant
talk.  I very nearly said: "Thank yourself,
Ma'am—I had no talk."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It took me back quite a long time to a
Bohemian night in Douglas Sladen's flat, at
Kensington, which was filled to overflowing with a
motley crew of what are popularly termed
"leading lights" of the stage, literature, and
art.  The party overflowed itself out to the
stairs.  I was caught in the passage beside
Hall Caine; he did not know me, though I
knew him.  How he talked!  I was grateful
to him, for it made me forget the weariness and
discomfort of the moment.  A day or two
later I got a letter from him, written at
Greeba Castle, Isle of Man, telling me that
the only thing he carried away from that party
was the memory of our interesting conversation.
There was no conversation that I could
recall.  What </span><em class="italics">I</em><span> had carried away was a very
interesting, one-man talk.  It was mostly
about himself, but one forgets that when it is
an interesting self.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To return to Anne, I should not discourage
that early love affair if I were you.  Some
girls need such for their education.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>From what you tell me about the boy, the
experience is not likely to seriously endanger
her future settlement in life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Don't worry, because she doesn't talk to you
about it.  You are the very last person in the
world she will make a confidant of in such an
affair.  You are too near of an age, yet not
near enough.  Besides, you are her mother.
Don't bully poor George.  He can't help it.
Fathers can't bring up girl-children; they only
make it more difficult for the mother.  He
can't do anything; and that he isn't worrying
should reassure you, I think.  We have to
admit that a man sees further and gets a grip of
the whole, while we are handling sections.
Leave it at that.  I mustn't close without
explaining why I am here in the midst of the
great camps stretching right through the heart
of Surrey to the sea.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Scenes of unimagined beauty have either
disappeared or become so horribly disfigured
as to be unrecognisable.  As I ride through
the wind and rain between the long lines of tin
and wooden huts, see the felled timber, the
burned heather, all the ugly features of the
military camp, I chalk up more and more
against the makers of war.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I feel sorry for all the people who have built
lovely homes and lordly dwelling places among
these matchless hills and downs.  They have
been so good about it, never grumbling or
standing in the way.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am talking every day to the boys.  Last
night I was at Bramshott.  But, oh, my dear,
it is not the same; the glow and the glory have
departed.  Those who radiated that white heat
of splendour are sleeping in quiet graves in
France, or Flanders, or on Eastern sands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am not suggesting that the stuff here is
not as good—in some respects, it might even
be better.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But youth has gone—these men have the
deep eyes of seeing men, and their mouths are
grimly set.  They are here because they have
no choice.  I think your draft bill is splendid,
but oh, I hoped great America would come
in on the volunteer basis.  There is something
different about it, something more finely
subtle.  I am conscious of the mighty difference
every time I stand up to speak to them.
They are not less determined that the fight
shall be to a finish, but they question more.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They are asking some explanation at the
hands of those who claim the sacrifice of their
homes and lives and all men hold dear.  Who
is to answer their righteous questioning?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Sometimes in my dreams I see a great
Judgment seat where Kings and Emperors, and
diplomats, and politicians, and wire pullers
and profiteers will have to answer to the blood
stained hosts they summoned to fight and die,
for what?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am due back in the French camps in about
ten days' time and I am half afraid to go.  I
can't answer all the questions they will put to
me.  I don't know enough.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the early days you could play upon their
mobile hearts as on a harp of ten strings;
tears and laughter and smiles we had then, all
side by side, with the most glorious courage the
world has ever seen.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In some of the battalions now you find the
fathers of the boys who sleep in Flanders and
in France.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Oh, Cornelia, the waste, the wanton waste
and cruelty of war.  Where is it tending?
Where shall we be brought before it is over?
Sometimes my brain reels at the thought.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Meanwhile the band is slowly tightening.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We have not had any butter at home for
over a week.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>The awful suspense about Himself I was
enduring when I wrote last was broken at last
by a cable from France.  It came from Effie
at Camiers and it took me some time to
grasp its meaning.  "Safe, unhurt; tell your
mother," was every word it said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Florence and I, poring distractedly over it
together, could only arrive at the conclusion
that there had been a disaster at sea, in which
our troopship was involved.  We did not even
know its name, from what port it had sailed,
or whither bound; in fact we did not know he
had sailed at all from the French base.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is the black darkness in which one has to
live which makes it so hard to be a soldier's
wife in war times.  A few more awful days
had to be lived through—whole ten of them,
then a long, closely written letter from Himself,
arrived from a port in France, whose very
name was not given.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But the story was wonderfully vivid and
full; in fact I didn't know how it had passed
the Censor, till I saw his own signature on the
envelope, indicating that he had censored it himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I must not enclose the letter, nor yet tell
you all it contained, because I want you to get
what I am writing.  These are the facts:</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They set sail from Marseilles after long,
dreary waiting in a particularly unpleasant
camp, and next morning at ten o'clock were
torpedoed off the Italian coast, not far from
Genoa.  Do you remember Genoa and its
terraces where we met first, so long ago that
it seems as if it must have been in some other
existence?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You know how Himself writes, very simply
and directly, without any embroideries, but
his narrative was far more impressive than if
he had tried to make it effective.  It simply
just makes you see it all, realise the horror
of it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The first torpedo disabled the ship, but if
the enemy had left it at that, she could have
been taken into port under her own steam.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was, of course, a good deal of excitement
and the boats were difficult to handle,
apparently they had never been inspected or
tested for any emergency.  Can you conceive
it, Cornelia, we have been three years at war
and yet such elementary precautions are left
to chance?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Priceless time was lost grappling with them,
and before they could be lowered, priceless
lives were lost.  Himself waiting calmly,
ready for the emergency,—or for the end, for
which he needed no preparation, saw the
second shell launched from the submarine.
Many of the boats had got clear.  One had the
sixty nurses who comprised the hospital unit;
sitting up to their middles in water, they sang
hymns to cheer those drifting helpless in the
sea.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The second torpedo found its mark amidships
and the gallant boat went down in eight
minutes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The only chance for those still remaining on
her decks was to jump into the sea.  But that
takes a special kind of courage; only those who
had it were saved; the rest went down in the
awful swirl of the sinking ship.  Himself was
picked up by a Japanese destroyer, filled with
wonder that he who had done his day's work
should have been saved, while so many of his
boys, with all their lives in front, should have
gone down.  It is a great mystery.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How often have we asked ourselves that
kind of question during these dreadful years.
So many of us would have gone so gladly in
their place.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They were landed at the port of Savonna.
The Italians were extraordinarily kind to
them, furnishing them with food and wine and
clothing of every kind.  He enclosed some
snapshots—one actually taken of the sinking
ship.  There will be people, I am sure, ready
with the camera on the Judgment Day.  One
of these snapshots depicts Himself in his
riding breeches and leggings and an Italian
military cloak, which makes him look like a
bandit.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He lost everything except that which he
happened to have on at the moment.  All the
lovely new Eastern kit, to say nothing of his
photographs, letters, and dear intimate
possessions, are at the bottom of the sea.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nothing matters except that he is safe.  He
has no idea what will happen to him now—he
supposes they will just have to wait for
another ship.  Meanwhile he is getting a little
respite from the Spartan rigours of one of the
worst cantonments he has ever struck, by
being a voluntary patient in a hospital.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What he says about that is very amusing.
He has been accustomed to boss a hospital,
and now he is being very effectively and
vigorously bossed.  I fear he is not chastened yet,
but only rebellious.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I can smile at it all because my heart is
lightened of its load.  God means him to come
back to me, or he would have gone down in
the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is odd how in this war, you have convictions
about this one and that; the sort of
presentiment who will get safely through, and
who will never come back.  But they are not
always true.  I felt so sure about Dick, of
whom I wrote in my last letter.  I felt that
his kind, the very highest type of fearless
soldier and a fine Christian gentleman, was so
much needed here, that God would care for
him specially.  When one thinks of how many
like him lie on the blood-soaked fields, one is
staggered, and uncertain about the future of
the race.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But we must leave it, leave it all and just
hold blindly on.  It has gotten clear beyond
us.  It is so big and awful, we can just not
grasp it at all.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>I am now a little like a Jack of all trades,
master of none.  Food is beginning to be
spelled with a very large capital and they tell
me I must talk about food.  I went to Scotland
for that purpose and to speak at a great
meeting in Glasgow Cathedral to commemorate
on the 4th of August those who had
fallen in the war.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is the first time a woman has ever lifted
up her voice in the Cathedral, and the occasion
caused some searching of heart.  The noble
edifice was absolutely packed and directly I
got up, standing at a specially selected spot in
the Nave, I forgot everything but the faces in
front, the great sorrowing heart of my own
country and its bitter need.  She is a very
little country, but none have more nobly done
their bit.  Do you know, Cornelia, that there
are villages in the north and west of Scotland
where the young men are all wiped out—where
there is no link between one generation
and another except the babies in arms.  There
are no sons left, no husbands for the girls.  It
was with these things my heart broke as I
tried to speak.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nowhere is there any grudging or holding
back.  At the overflow meeting that had to be
held in an adjoining church a woman came up
at the close, a little plain country woman in
mourning with a bag on her arm.  From it
she took three photographs of soldiers in
Highland dress and a war office telegram which
she laid against one of the lads.  "That came
yesterday," she said.  "It's Jamie—he's the
last——"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>All gone and she a widow.  What is one to
say to a woe like that?  Where is compensation
to be found?  There will have to be something
very satisfying over there beside the
river of God to make up for the roll of the
whelming billows here.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I went on from Glasgow to Dundee to speak
to two thousand women about the necessity for
saving food.  The situation is becoming acute
and it has to be explained to the people.  I
have come to the conclusion that food is the
supreme test.  They'll give almost anything
more cheerfully, go into small houses, wear old
clothes, economise anywhere but on what is
vulgarly called their "inwards."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then you see our industrial population was
never better off.  In the shipbuilding districts,
the munition areas—the great textile
neighbourhoods, they are simply piling it up.  Of
course they want all the things money can
buy.  I am sure I should, if I had been
cheated out of them for a whole section of my
life.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So you can't blame these people for buying
salmon at four shillings per pound, the best
beefsteaks and prime cuts from the joints,
when they can get them.  But the trouble is
they can't now get them, so there is grumbling
and unrest.  They have got it into their heads
that the government is hoarding the stuff and
that favour is being shown.  So labour has
said that it will go short if capital goes short
with them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is a perfectly reasonable proposition and
the sooner the card ration scheme comes into
operation, the better.  It will not solve the
whole problem, of course, nor yet increase
incredulously or automatically the available
stores.  What it will do is to ensure equal
distribution.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I, for one, hope Lord Rhondda won't lose
any more time.  I am afraid my letters are
getting less and less interesting.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What you asked for was a plain, unvarnished
record of war conditions here, which you
want to keep, and I am setting them down as
simply and faithfully as I know how.  We are
getting bit by bit down to the sordid bedrock
where we are face to face with the hideous
nakedness of war.  There are things that the
glow and glory of our Pentecostal sacrifice can
hardly illumine.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In my deep heart I feel that we are coming
to them soon, and that we shall need more
different kinds of courage than at any time
during those searching, aging, interminable years.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>I got back to find that the war office has
commandeered our "substitute" for active
service.  There is no one else to be got, so the
door will have to be shut.  It means that our
living is all gone except what Cook calls "the
Capting's pay."  Cook himself is working at
munitions now after having successfully
planted the potato patch.  So there is only
Florence and me left, and we don't eat much.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Life truly is shorn for me of much of its
dignity, and the amazing thing is that one doesn't
mind—we are not our own any more, but
bought with a price.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A woman condoled with me not long ago
over the house being destroyed.  All I could
think of was to say as cheerfully as possible,
"You can get another house, but there is only
one country."  I must just keep on saying it
to myself over and over, but sometimes when
there is nobody looking, I am afraid I don't
hold my diminished head so high.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Food is the question of the hour.  The
people who have read with uncomprehending eyes
the imploring official appeals "Eat less bread,"
"Save the Wheat," "Food will win the War,"
are now face to face with real shortage.  The
psychology of this war, in so far as it operates
in human consciousness, is a very remarkable
thing.  I had to sit down to think it over this
morning after a very exhausting argument
with a food waster and hoarder.  These two
words don't sort together, do they, but they
are apt to the hour.  He or she who hoards
food at this moment of national stress, wastes
it, because he is preserving it for his own
wretched body, which is of no value to his
country.  A few minutes' silent contemplation
brought me into a clearer light.  The absolute
refusal of those people to admit the need
for conservation and self-denial, is a form of
national pride.  They simply can't admit the
humiliating fact that Great Britain, proud
mistress of the seas, is no longer self-supporting
or sufficient to her own needs.  They
never knew, of course, that in our most
prosperous years we could produce only forty per
cent. of what we consumed.  And if they had
known it, would it have made any difference?
It is all so very English, so dogged, so
unchanged and unchangeable.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But even this partially comforting reflection,
that the grumblers and obstructionists are
really patriots in disguise doesn't ease the
situation or fill the empty store cupboards.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And I am in it now, Cornelia, up to the neck
in it.  Having filled many rôles, I have now
become a food expert, from whose lips calories
and proteids and other heathen words ought to
flow glibly.  Only they don't.  I am a plain
woman and most people are plain in the same
sense.  They hate camouflage; it worries and
wearies them.  I am trying to tell as simply
as I can, how they may make up with other
things, for the things that are not there.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It does not read very clearly or convincingly,
does it?  But that is my job.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is not easy.  Food is not an inspiring
theme.  You cannot wax eloquent over it; the
only dramatic moments are those when you
flame red with indignation over the breaking
down of the voluntary system.  It has failed
all along the line, and card rationing is bound
to come.  There have been several distressing
instances from sources where we had every
reason to look for better things—ay, even for
leadership in high ethics.  But alas! the
temptation to be secure against more troublous
times was too great for resistance.  All this
causes a searching of heart lest there should be
very weak points left in my armour.  I am
determined that in this particular respect I
shall do rather more than my share.  I am
kept up to high-water-mark by Florence.
She really ought to have a medal for
allegiance to the Government under the most
trying conditions.  She has weighed everything,
done all the things I might not have done,
stood firm between me and every temptation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If food doesn't actually win the war, at least
its shortage is searching the hearts and trying
the reins of the children of men.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>All the time wrestling with those sordid
details, trying to interest people in oatmeal
and bones, and the superiority of casserole
cooking over the waste of roast and frying,
I have to keep thinking of the glory and
travail which is bound up in it all.  If you
haven't something to illumine with, if only a
farthing dip, you just can't go on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Although some people have complimented
me on my housekeeping, a lot of it doesn't
really interest me much.  It is no credit to me
that I happened to be born determined to do
my job well.  Even in the great old dinner-giving
days, long before the deluge, when we
vied with one another in frantic endeavours to
discover something entirely new, with which
to decorate our menu cards, and fill other
women with hopeless envy, the game never
seemed worth the candle.  After all, it takes
very little to keep us alive.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The things that interested me most in those
great dinner contests was the eager look in the
eyes of the women as they sampled the
unknown and sometimes fearsome looking dish.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The men usually showed their discrimination
by leaving the entrées severely alone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Where in Heaven's name am I wandering
to?  We housekeepers have at last got
something really testing to whet our axes upon.
We have got to invent and concoct appetising
dishes minus most of the ingredients we once
thought necessary to them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This is going to be the testing fight.  I am
learning great new lessons every day.  I only
wish I could pass them on.  A woman came
up to me in the street the other day and said:
"Please, I've tried to do what you said wi' them
substitoots (oh, the scorn in her voice!).  But
'Arry, 'e won't look at 'em.  Calls 'em messes,
'e does; wants 'is 'onest beefsteak, 'e does, an'
I don't blime 'im, either."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Neither do I, nevertheless it will be my
mournful duty to try and impress on him and
all the other Harrys who are making the lives
of their helpmeets a burden over this food
conservation business, that the true patriot is the
man who eats his imitation steak with a smile,
assuring the woman who has laboured over its
preparation that it is quite equal to the real
thing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nobody would be deceived, but life would
be easier.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I never before realised that bread is really
the staple food of our working folks.  It is
rather humiliating to discover how scanty are
the reserves we are now able to call up.  When
you speak to the average cottage woman about
soup and explain how nourishing it is for the
children and how cheaply it can be prepared
out of bones, if only the necessary care is
bestowed on it, she has a way of putting her
hands on her hips and looking you very
haughtily in the face with the air of a person
receiving a personal insult.  "Feed me chillen
on bones!  Good Lord! 'as it come to that?
Not me, thank you, ma'am.  I'll get me bit
o' meat and bread and butter as long as I can
get 'em and wen they ain't to be got, will do
without."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How are you to combat that sort of argument
which is everywhere, like sorrow—"not
in single spies, but in battalions"!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I shall have to think hard.  These people
have got to be educated.  The whole process
of teaching them the alphabet has to be
entered on now, when we are in the thick of the
testing fight.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Oh, it is so very, very English, so tremendously,
unutterably stupid, and maddening!  I
shall have to stop off or I shall be writing down
things that the admirable George, with his
exclusive command of strong language, will not
permit you to read.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As usual, when one arrives at the end of
one's tether, something happens, and there,
right in front at the end of what looked like a
blind alley, stood the open door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Administration, having fully tested the
value of the Communal Kitchen, has sent out
advices to the country to establish them
wherever possible.  As Chairman of our Kitchen
Committee, I went to London with another
member—a delightful, practical, breezy
person, to inspect the working of the big
experimental Kitchen on Westminster Bridge Road.
It was thoroughly interesting and for the first
time hope of solutions of many problems
dawned on our weary spirits.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We returned home to report and got authority
to act.  I will explain the Communal
Kitchen to you, though it is incredible to
imagine your great, rich and inexhaustible country
ever coming even within long-distance range
of such a contingency.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Communal or Central Kitchen is established
and run by experts for the cooking of a
large number of meals at the lowest possible
cost.  A first-class plant is necessary, the most
up-to-date ovens, steamers, utensils of every
kind.  The cook must not only be an expert,
but an artist, as she has to disguise many
inferior ingredients and make them appetising
for her consumers.  Stores are purchased,
wherever possible, in large quantities, special
permits, of course, being afforded by the
vigilant Food Administrators.  Thus considerable
saving is effected.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The cook and her immediate assistant or
assistants are highly paid workers, but those
who apportion and handle the food, over the
counters, are volunteers, giving about four
hours' service every day.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>No food is consumed on the premises.  The
customers bring their own utensils in which
they carry their portions away.  There is a
very complete and clever system of tickets issued
at a little box office near the door, so that
no money is tendered at the counter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The menu cards are hung in the windows so
that customers may make their choice before
they come inside.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We went early, watched the cooking in
process, got stuffed up with unheard-of knowledge
of every kind, and then waited for the
customers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They interested me beyond everything; although
it is a very poor neighbourhood, it was
not the very poor who came.  Some quite well
dressed people, with baskets nicely covered and
lined, appeared and were more than satisfied.
One bank clerk's wife assured me that it was
the greatest Godsend to her, because she was
working, too, and they were both now assured
of one good warm, substantial meal every day,
and nothing else mattered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A mother of seven, "steps and stairs," clinging
to her skirts had tears in her eyes as she
spoke of the salvation the Kitchen had brought
to her family.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When I saw the quarts of soup disappearing
in jugs and pails through the swing doors,
I took fresh heart and decided to make
another onslaught on the Amazonian mother
who would let her offspring "go without"
instead of "demeaning 'erself" to any truck with
bones.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Have you ever noticed how a little thing can
change the whole outlook; how you can be
transported by a lift of the brows, the glimpse
of some unexpected object, miles from your
base?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As I sat there behind the counter of the
Communal Kitchen in the Westminster
Bridge Road, I was suddenly transported to
South Germany, to that little Bavarian
university town we both know so well.  What do
you think transported me?  Why, the sight of
a student-like person, German, surely, carrying
the little arrangement of dishes in a stand
(I've forgotten its German name and glory in
the lapse), which used to bring my greasy
dinner from the hotel Drei Mohren.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Did these days really exist?  Do you
remember my landlady with the sweet, deprecating
smile, her painful humility, her awe and
worship of the temporal powers that ruled her
destiny?  How we distrusted it all, sure that
it was a false foundation for life, and that
freedom is the heritage of the human soul!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Even then, we were both conscious of
hidden fires—of smouldering hates.  They were
deferential to us; yet inwardly loathing,
perhaps fearing us.  They have not changed at
all, Cornelia, the little river which watered
German sentiment in that horrid mediæval
place, has only broadened and widened into a
vast and overwhelming sea.  They were
getting ready even then.  I could see it in the
jealous eyes of the women, their veiled and
laboured politeness at the coffee parties had
nothing convincing about it.  It did not
warmly enfold you like the gracious hospitality
of kindred peoples.  They were bidden to
hate, and they knew how to do it, and could veil
their fine accomplishment in the art.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Oh, Cornelia, where am I now?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Food Expert has got out of bounds.
Call her back, discipline her; make her toe
the line.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The outcome of that interesting morning is
that we have a Communal Kitchen and it is
going to be a tremendous success.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Some doubts had to be dispelled.  People
have to be convinced that it is not a charity,
bearing the brand of the soup kitchen, or the
Penny Dinner scheme.  We have tried to explain
that it is merely co-ordinating the forces;
co-operation on a large scale.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We have gotten the cook, the machinery, the
volunteers, and I think we are going to sleep
more soundly "o' nights" because of it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At least the children will be better fed.
Some of them are getting to look so peaky,
for milk has been very scarce all winter, and
butter a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We just simply daren't sit down to think of
the children.  It must seem so strange and
cruel to them.  What have they to do with the
quarrels of Emperors and Kings and Diplomatists?
They are heirs of all the ages and
have the right to live in peace and comfort,
none daring to make them afraid.  Sometimes
I have a nightmare of the first indictment this
young generation will bring up at the Day of
Judgment—the children who have known
naught but terror—the sons who have had to
die before they lived—the widowed girls and
the girls who never will taste the joy of
wifehood or motherhood, but must go unmated to
their graves.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Almost it makes me long to be there lying
sweetly and unconsciously beside the quiet
dead.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have no letters from Himself.  Where he
is—whether alive or dead—how can I tell?  I
haven't even the poor consolation of writing
to him—because I have no address.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There is no glory in war for women's hearts,
Cornelia.  To-day I am neither proud nor
glad, but only sorry to be a soldier's wife.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>I have been reading over your last letter
and find that my impassioned tirade about
Food left many of your questions unanswered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What you tell me about the present state
of your war activities takes me back about
three years to the time when we were at the
same stage.  Have you noticed that one woman's
matrimonial experience is not of the slightest
use to another?  It doesn't even help her
to avoid quite obvious pitfalls.  War seems to
me to be a little like that.  Every country has
to "dree her own weird" in it—grope for her
soul in her own particular way.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One of Lloyd George's speeches put the
matter in a nut shell: "To peace-loving
peoples war is a trackless waste—an undiscovered
country through which a pathway has to be
made."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>That being so, there must of necessity be
side tracking.  I see your George stamping
about in righteous indignation because things
are not being "put over" with the rapidity and
despatch which seem to him essential.  Tell
him he'll just have to possess his soul in
patience, and don't let him do anything foolish.
He'll only hinder thereby.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I do hope and pray most fervently, however,
that you are exaggerating the state of affairs.
I wonder why it is that the war machine has
such a tendency to become unwieldy.  It needs
not any vivid imagination, nor a particularly
brilliant intelligence to grasp the magnitude
of your war task.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You have almost everything the old world
now lacks, your trouble is to co-ordinate your
forces from sea to sea, and get them into line.
Colossus can't move with the agility of his
lesser brethren, we must comfort ourselves
and stay our impatience with that reflection.
I am sure you will hate leaving your lovely
home, but Washington will have compensations.
I could not, somehow, imagine or contemplate
existence for myself very far from
London, in wartime, at least for any length of
time.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I don't agree with all you say about the
mobilisation of your women for war.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There is no other way of doing it; and the
things you tell me are only the excrescences of
a great forward movement, the shock of which
will soon make itself felt throughout the
entire country.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We, too, had the kind of women you criticise
so severely.  I knew one whose first act of
war service for her country was the purchase
of a red cross of rubies to wear with her
uniform.  She went to France with it, but
abandoned it before very long.  The real cross,
when she came up with it, red with the blood
of brave men, put her to shame.  She has won
the saint's crown out there, and her name has
been on a hundred dying lips.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So don't worry about these little things,
Cornelia, they will pass as a tale that is told.
The best will remain—the things that cannot
be shaken, and which are the same in all
countries, and of all peoples.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>God, how I cling to that text.  I have to say
it over and over a hundred times a day.  We
are getting so badly shaken here that sometimes
we feel as if we had no foundation whatsoever.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I don't know whether I have made you
understand that a big section of England now
is as truly the war zone as that across the
Channel.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The air raids are increasing in number and
intensity; this week we had four nights in the
cellar.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There are not so many oddities about the
proceedings now we have settled in to the game
in dead earnest.  When we get the warning
we act with as little delay as possible, seek
one nearest available shelter, where we sit
down to endure the strain as best we can.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There is precious little badinage now about
the Zeppelin parties; we all feel that they have
long passed the amusing stage.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Can you read between the lines?  I wonder
have you grasped the fact that the strain is
becoming almost more than we can bear?  I
have the dreadful feeling that perhaps I
myself will not be able to hold out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You know I never could do without sleep;
my too active brain has always demanded its
full measure, and rebelled when cheated of it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A Zeppelin night means anything from
seven or eight o'clock at night till four in the
morning—the strain of tension and fear never
relaxed for a moment.  Always you are listening,
listening—and the gunfire never ceases.
It is punctuated by the noise of the explosions
following the bomb dropping, which means,
though it may be a good many miles from you,
that somebody is being punished.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We still speak about the Zeppelins, though
they don't come any more.  Their successors,
the Gothas, are not less terrible; in fact they
seem to be more daring, more destructive,
faster and less vulnerable.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Also they are equipped with all kinds of new
and terrible death-dealing weapons.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A very strange one descended on our little
town night before last.  We heard a noise like
a rushing mighty wind or an express train,
going at lightning speed through the air.  It
was not the usual steady whir of the Gotha's
engine.  The thing fell in a garden at the top
of Queen's Hill and then exploded, doing much
damage to houses, though mercifully no one
was killed.  They say it was an aerial torpedo
which travels through the air by its own
momentum.  If this is true, imagine what
magnitude this form of attack might achieve and
how much we may yet have to suffer!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How often one is appalled by this dedication
of human will and mind power to the devil's
service.  Is there to be no limit set to it?
Is it the beginning of the terrors which will
make men call on the rocks to cover them?
You have no idea, Cornelia, what a weak helpless
thing humanity is until it is subjected to
this sort of thing.  It isn't clean fighting; it
makes brave men desperate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I think on the whole the women bear it
better.  They are more used to suffering and
never forget to be protective.  All sorts of
moving things happen about the children.  One
poor woman stretched herself over her two
children on the floor as the torpedo was
coming, hoping to receive the brunt herself.  None
of them were hurt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But these things are getting home, Cornelia,
they are telling on us all.  Little portents show
the weakening of the fibre here and there.  I
am feeling it myself, while all the time fighting
against it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Of course the chief object of these diabolical
visitations is just that, so to weaken the moral
stamina that we people will cry for peace at
any price.  That cry will never be heard in
this country, Cornelia, not if he sends his aerial
torpedoes hurtling through the sky, world
without end.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There is no grumbling, surprisingly little
protest anywhere.  Our people accept these
things as part of the horrible business in which
we are presently engaged.  They don't even
know how to hate properly.  We have a
German prison camp nearby, the men being
employed in the woods, cutting and preparing the
timber of which so many of our finest properties
are now being denuded.  These men are
scared to death in the raids, but though you
may hear an occasional hope expressed that a
bomb might fall on the prison camp, I question
whether, if you drove it home, you would
find they really desired such a thing to
happen.  We are not successful haters; we are
only clean fighters, and desperate lovers of
peace.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Can you accept that paradoxical presentment
which is an actual description of our
mental attitude?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The children in the war zone here are beginning
to exercise us; some of them are really
subnormal now, like their poor little brothers
and sisters in the other countries.  Those who
can, remove them to safer places, sending them
often to relations in remote parts of the
country.  Children quickly droop when their
sleeping hours are shortened or much disturbed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The school teachers find them either restless
or extremely languid after an air raid; and
cannot urge them to concentrate on their
lessons.  One wee chap in our cellar, in his
pajamas the other night, said pathetically to his
mother, with eyes heavy with sleep: "Mummy,
you won't get me up next night, will you, till
they are really here?"</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">

<p class="pfirst"><span>No, I am not hearing regularly from Himself.
There has been no letter for weeks and
weeks.  Whether they are being torpedoed
when written, or not written at all, I don't
know.  There is only the blank wall of silence.
How much can the human heart stand, I
wonder?  We are amazing creatures, bound by
"cords which come from out eternity."</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Yes, I have read Sir Oliver Lodge's book
and had some correspondence with him about
it.  Somehow he got it into his head that I
had written a rather brutal, unsigned article
on it in the </span><em class="italics">Daily Mail</em><span>.  Writing to refute
this, I set forth my views on spiritualism and
the intervention of mediums between us and
those who have passed on.  We say "gone
away" in Scotland, and I think I like it better.
He sent me a long letter in reply.  I will
enclose you a copy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I don't think there is any road that way.
The only key to the grave was left on the stone
of the sepulchre on the Resurrection morning.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Do you remember the Leightons—Robert
and Marie?  They lost their beautiful son, not
the only, but the favourite one, in France, and
she has written a beautiful book about him,
called "Boy of My Heart."  It is the best thing
by far she has ever written, and immensely
worth reading.  She is now side-tracking with
the rest along these doubtful and bewildering
paths.  Oh, I wish people wouldn't.  To me
it seems a kind of desecration.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If I can have any communication with my
son, I don't want to have it through some
strange, odd freak of a person, who has to go
into a trance for the purpose.  If God means
me to hear from the other side, He will send
the Boy to me direct.  That I most firmly
believe, and am content to wait that day.  If
it never comes, why then I can go on waiting
for the day which can't be so very far distant,
when I shall cross the narrow sea between that
happy land and ours.  I wrote as strongly and
convincingly as I could to Mrs. Leighton, but
I don't think it availed much.  There is a little
group of the intellectuals just now all heading
in the same direction, names familiar all the
world over.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To me it is all intensely pathetic.  It is the
cry of lost youth, the admission that they have
no real city or abiding place, and no sort of
surety about what is going to come.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I remember Himself coming in one day and
sending me out to a dying woman with the
words: "I'm through with my job.  It's yours
now."  When I got to her she looked at me
so wistfully, saying: "Doctor says you are so
sure."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>You have no idea how these words thrilled
me.  Thank God I am sure.  We are all sure,
who know in Whom we have believed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Since I wrote to you last I have had
disquieting news about Effie.  She was knocked
down, while standing beside her car, by a big
French military motor.  The officers riding in
it did not even stop to pick her up.  Possibly
they were not even aware that anything had
happened.  One must be charitable enough to
suppose so.  Some one came along and took
her to a hospital, from which she is now able to
send a few pencilled lines.  She escaped with a
few good bruises and it was quite a few days
before I could discover whether there was any
facial injury.  Nobody seemed to reflect that I
might be worrying about that.  I applied for
permission to go over to see her, but was
refused.  Nobody is permitted to cross the
Channel to visit wounded or sick relatives unless the
case is hopeless.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her temperature kept up obstinately for
longer than they liked, but I am thankful to
say she is now convalescent.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have had shoals of letters from all kinds
of people over there, from the Brigadier to the
orderly, expatiating on her absolute
indispensability at the Base.  They seem terrified
in case we order her to come home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is very sweet to hear that she is so greatly
beloved, and doing efficiently and cheerfully
so much useful service.  What experience she
must have locked in her too uncommunicative
bosom!  She has had three years of it now, and
has really told us very little.  If she never tries
to express it in writing, well, it surely will
inform and colour all her after life.  I should
not dare to bid her home on my own responsibility,
though there are days when I not only
want, but need her desperately.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Talking of the modernity of these inaccessible,
mysterious young creatures, I don't think
I told you of a friend of mine, mother of four,
who soon after the outbreak of war, received
from her family a letter signed by each
member, thanking her for permitting them to be
born at the psychological moment of history.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Another friend of mine who had the misfortune
to marry a full-blooded and very German
German, who, however, conveniently departed
this life the year before the war, told me her
sons passionately reproached her for giving
them a German father.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One gets bewildered in this strange hurly-burly
where every mask seems to be torn off
and the decencies of life hardly respected any
more.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am so glad you are easier in your mind
about Anne.  Effie was tremendously
interested.  All she said was "Anne will never
marry that one; he's only experimental."  Perhaps
that may comfort you a little.  Presumably,
these birds of a feather understand one
another!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Sometimes I have the awful feeling that
Effie has passed out of the region of my love
and care.  Yet how dare I intrude these little
personal fears upon a world's sorrow?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Every day I am writing letters to fathers
and mothers whose darlings have gone forever
"where, beyond these voices, there is peace."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One grows heart weary of the task, and
even the balm of Gilead seems to have lost
its power to soothe or heal.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Yet often and often I am thrilled by the
courage and calmness and faith of those who
have given the most.  They are upheld and
illumined by some white and lovely flame which
surely emanates from the secret place of the
Most High.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Never has there been such glory of sacrifice
ennobled by that passion for the right
which lifts those whom it inspires very high,
above ignoble things.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>My country was never greater than now,
Cornelia.  Shorn and blood-stained, she is
worthy to be numbered with those who are
arrayed in white robes and have come out of
great tribulation.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>A wonderful, wonderful thing has just
happened.  I don't know quite how to tell you.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I have been asked by our Foreign Office to
go to America and tell part of the story of
what we have done in the war and what the
war has done for us.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Do you understand, Cornelia, I am coming
to you, right now, by the very earliest
boat?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>God has undoubtedly opened this door.  I
shall be so glad to leave the tired Old World
for a spell, and drink at the Fount of your
glorious youth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Even the submarines can't scare me away
from this great Adventure.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At this moment America means only you
and George and dear little Anne, and the
heavenly rest under your roof tree.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Perhaps it may prove to be something very
different, but that is how I am feeling at the
moment.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>God will surely forgive me for this
momentary slackening.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I am so tired, Cornelia.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Only God knows how tired I am!</span></p>
